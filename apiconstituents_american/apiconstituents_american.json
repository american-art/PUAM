"Biography":"Gerardus Duyckinck, a third generation painter-craftsman of Dutch descent, was baptized on 19 June 1695 in New York City. In 1735 he advertised his skills as a limner, painter, gilder, japanner, and dealer in looking-glasses and artists' colors \"at the Sign of the two Cupids, near the Old Slip Market\" in Manhattan. He is recorded in Schenectady in October 1738 and in Claverack in October 1742 as a sponsor at the baptism of relatives. This gives some indication of the extent of his travels outside of New York City. On 8 January 1744 or 1745 he was one of five lay signers of a letter on behalf of the Consistory of the Dutch Church of New York to gentlemen in Amsterdam, reporting the arrival of the dominie Johannes Ritzema. Duyckinck died in Kingston, New York, on 26 July 1746. In August of that year his son Gerardus advertised that he \"continues to carry on the Business of his late Father, deceas'd...\"\r\n\r\nIn the 1940s several portraits were tentatively linked to the elder Gerardus on the basis of style and his relationship by blood or marriage to the sitters. At least one scholar concluded that Duyckinck probably painted very little. In 1976 a painting of the birth of the Virgin, signed and dated Gerardus Duyckinck\/1713, was published. This is the only known signed and dated work by Gerardus Duyckinck. Since then, more paintings have been linked to the signed work on the basis of stylistic comparison and scientific analysis. [This is an edited version of the artist's biography published, or to be published, in the NGA Systematic Catalogue]--National Gallery of Art.",

"Biography":"American painter, photographer, and sculptor, best known for his precise, exacting paintings in the tradition of the Barbizon School and Velásquez. He studied with Gérome and others in Paris from 1866-1869, but returned to Philadelphia in 1870 where he painted local figures and scenes that emphasized emotional truth and visual fact. His interest in science led to probably his best-known painting, \"The Gross Clinic\" (1875), showing the famous surgeon in the operating theater. The picture shocked contemporaries with its frank depiction of blood. Eakins taught at the Philadelphia Academy of the Arts from 1876-1878, reforming the teaching methods and giving priority to painting from live nude models as oppose to drawing from plaster casts.

"Biography":"John Flanagan (1865–1952) was a sculptor who designed the Washington U.S. quarter dollar coin, which was issued in 1932. Flanagan's initials can be found at the base of Washington's neck. Flanagan designed both sides of the quarter. Flanagan designed a medallion commemorating the World War I Battle of Verdun. The inscription on it reads, 'They Shall Not Pass', and the medal is found in the Lafayette Database of American Art in French National collections. From 1885 to 1890, Flanagan was a studio assistant to Augustus St. Gaudens and worked on several large projects. A bronze portrait bust of St. Gaudens by Flanagan is found at New York University.

In 1948 he traveled to Peru and Bolivia, and from 1949 to 1951 he worked in England, Wales, United Kingdom and France. In 1955, Frank travelled across the United States taking photographs for his book 'The Americans'. The book caused great criticism for its depictions of American pop culture, which were labeled 'neurotic'. From 1957 to 1969 he worked as a photographer, filmmaker, and independent producer in New York City, eventually moving to Nova Scotia in 1969 with his wife, artist June Leaf (ULAN).",

Two collections of his work have been published, \"The Extraordinary Landscape,\" (1982) and \"William Garnett Aerial Photographs,\" (1984). An ardent conservationist, Garnett became concerned about land use and air pollution in the early 1940s. He made this photograph in an attempt to raise public awareness. Over the years Garnett came to believe that he was more likely to inspire positive change by pointing out nature's enduring beauty than by showing the ugliness caused by poor choices. ULAN",

"Biography":"Joseph Brown \r\nLecturer with rank of Professor in Visual Arts, Emeritus \r\nPrinceton University\r\n\r\nJoseph Brown, a sculptor of widely diversified abilities, taught at Princeton University for almost four decades. He saw nothing incongruous in his two apparently unrelated interests—sculpture and athletics. In the spring of 1962 he retired from the Department of Athletics and Physical Education after his 25 th season as Instructor of Boxing. He taught sculpture from 1939 until he retired from the faculty in 1977; he is Lecturer with rank of Professor in Visual Arts, Emeritus. \r\n\r\nA native of the once rough-and-ready Grays Ferry Section of Philadelphia, Pa., Brown (born: March 20, 1909 ) first caught the public eye as a Temple University undergraduate. Entering Temple on a football scholarship in 1927, he concentrated his efforts on boxing and was captain of the team in 1929. He turned professional later that year and won nine straight bouts as a light heavyweight. \r\n\r\nAlthough he had reached the “main-event class,” Brown decided that there “must be a better way to make a living.” He banked his ring earnings and continued his studies at Temple , graduating with a B.S. in education in 1931. \r\n\r\nAn opportunity to pick up a few dollars modeling struck the spark which led to his development as one of the country's best known sculptors. While posing for sculptor Walker Hancock and illustrator Douglas Duer, he tried a small sculpture himself. Hancock was so impressed that he sent Brown some materials and encouraged him to go ahead on his own. \r\n\r\nBrown did exactly that. He turned out two boxing figures and a dancer, borrowed a book on casting and –without benefit of formal study—had all three pieces accepted for exhibit by the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts annual exhibition. \r\n\r\nHis first sculptures caught the eye of the late R. Tait McKenzie, who invited him to work in his studio as his apprentice. For the next seven years (1931-1938) Brown served a different apprenticeship, evolving the techniques which have since won a number of national awards, including the National Academy of Design's Barnet Prize for Sculpture. Unlike many of his contemporaries, Brown has never divorced art from everyday experiences and athletes. \r\n\r\nIn 1937 he was named boxing instructor at Princeton until 1962, and in 1939 was appointed Resident Fellow in Sculpture under the then new Creative Arts Program. He conducted popular courses in the practice of sculpture until his retirement in 1977. \r\n\r\nDuring World War II, Brown was a consultant to the Secretary of War and was a member of the Founding Faculty when the Army Ground and Service Forces established the Physical Trainers and Athletic Directors School at Lexington , Va. His ideas about the teaching of boxing influenced the Army to revamp its program of physical training in 1944. \r\n\r\nIn 1954 he presented a paper at the National Recreation Congress and exhibited models of “play Communities,” designated to re-establish play as “a preparation for the responsibilities of maturity.” Since then full-sized models have been installed in playgrounds in London, Tokyo, Philadelphia, the New Jersey Neuro-Psychiatric Institute (now know as the North Princeton Development Center) and many other public playgrounds. An article by Brown, “Unpredictability—Margin for Inspiration” which appeared in Architectural Record , brought invitations for articles in the French magazine Arcitecture aujourd'hui , the Italian magazine Domus , and the Danish magazine Arkitektur . \r\n\r\nIn 1961 professor Brown went on a four-month State Department goodwill tour, under the auspices of the Department's American Specialist Branch. In Japan , Taiwan , Indonesia , Thailand and Burma, he conducted scores of boxing clinics, gave dozens of lectures on sculpture, and turned out 16 statuettes and four small busts, most of them depicting local athletic heroes from the areas he visited. \r\n\r\nProfessor Brown was authorized by the State Department to return to Asia the following year to deliver the bronzes of his statuettes, in person, in Japan, Taiwan, Thailand and Burma. \r\n\r\nIn 1967, Brown received the annual Distinguished Service Citation of the American Association for Health, Physical Education, and Recreation, a department of the National Education Association, in recognition of his “meritorious service as a n educational leader” and for his contributions to “programs of education for children, youth, and adults. \r\n\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAthlete, educator and artist, Joe Brown was gifted in many areas.\r\n\r\nOne of Brown's natural talents was boxing. Brown began his boxing career at Temple University and became the Amateur Athletic Union's (AAU) heavyweight champion. He was lured away from the amateur realm by the money and fame of the professional boxing world. His professional career was short-lived.\r\n\r\nA boxing injury resulted in Brown's introduction to the world of art in 1929. He became a model for a sculpting class and soon realized he was interested in sculpting. That year he sculpted a boxer, his brother Harry, and a ballet dancer. All three works were accepted into the annual exhibition at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts.\r\n\r\nAfter graduating from Temple University in 1931 with a bachelor's degree in education, Brown apprenticed to sculptor, physician, and educator Dr. R. Tait McKenzie. McKenzie often warned Brown, \"Don't plan on making a living with your art, because if you try, you will be shaped by the fashions in art and cease to be an artist, because you will no longer work from the basis of personal experience.\" Brown heeded this advice and combined teaching and coaching with art.\r\n\r\nIn 1938, Brown was hired as Princeton University's boxing coach.\r\n\r\nDuring his tenure as boxing coach, the Academic Dean of Princeton University, Christian Gauss, noticed a bronze statue of the champion swimmer Duke Kahanomoku on a desk. Guass was told the artist was Joe Brown - the boxing coach. Brown had kept silent about his artistic talent, fearing that the mix of art and athletics would be viewed as a weakness. Instead, this mixture was viewed as a strength and Brown became a Resident Fellow of Sculpture. He became a full Professor of Art in 1962 and retired from Princeton in 1977.\r\n\r\nThroughout his career, Brown sculpted what he knew best-sports. His works in the National Art Museum of Sport include \"Dropped, Antaeus, 1951,\" \"Boxer Bandaging His Hand,\" and \"Hurling.\" They were donated to the Museum by Dr. Louis A. Pyle, Jr., who had been a Princeton boxer and posed for \"Boxer Bandaging his Hand.\" A bronze of a gymnast was recently given the Museum.\r\n\r\nVeterans' Stadium, the former home of the Philadelphia Phillies and the Philadelphia Eagles, was the site of four 16-foot bronzes by Joe Brown. With the construction of a new stadium, the bronzes have been installed as public art in other parts of Philadelphia. He not only sculpted works of sport, but also famous people such as John Steinbeck and Robert Frost.\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/www.namos.iupui.edu\/Artist.aspx?artist=145\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nJoe Brown graduated from Temple University in 1931 at the height of the depression. He couldn't get a position as a physical education instructor, but since he was an athlete he got a job posing for artists at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. There he was tempted to try sculpting himself, and the three pieces he produced were accepted by the Academy for exhibition. His work caught the eye of Dr. R. Tait McKenzie, a noted physician and sculptor. Brown served a seven-year apprenticeship to Dr. McKenzie and then joined the Princeton University staff as boxing coach in 1937,until 1962, and in 1939 was appointed Resident Fellow in Sculpture under the then new Creative Arts Program. He conducted popular courses in the practice of sculpture until his retirement in 1977.\r\n\r\nDuring World War II, Brown was a consultant to the Secretary of War and was a member of the Founding Faculty when the Army Ground and Service Forces established the Physical Trainers and Athletic Directors School at Lexington , Va. His ideas about the teaching of boxing influenced the Army to revamp its program of physical training in 1944. In 1954 he presented a paper at the National Recreation Congress and exhibited models of “play Communities,” designated to re-establish play as “a preparation for the responsibilities of maturity.” Since then full-sized models have been installed in playgrounds in London, Tokyo, Philadelphia, the New Jersey Neuro-Psychiatric Institute (now know as the North Princeton Development Center) and many other public playgrounds. An article by Brown, “Unpredictability—Margin for Inspiration” which appeared in Architectural Record , brought invitations for articles in the French magazine Arcitecture aujourd'hui , the Italian magazine Domus , and the Danish magazine Arkitektur. \r\n\r\nIn 1961 professor Brown went on a four-month State Department goodwill tour, under the auspices of the Department's American Specialist Branch. In Japan , Taiwan , Indonesia , Thailand and Burma, he conducted scores of boxing clinics, gave dozens of lectures on sculpture, and turned out 16 statuettes and four small busts, most of them depicting local\r\nathletic heroes from the areas he visited.\r\n\r\nProfessor Brown was authorized by the State Department to return to Asia the following year to deliver the bronzes of his statuettes, in person, in Japan, Taiwan, Thailand and Burma. In 1967, Brown received the annual Distinguished Service Citation of the American Association for Health, Physical Education, and Recreation, a department of the National Education Association, in recognition of his “meritorious service as a n educational leader” and for his contributions to “programs of education for children, youth, and adults.\r\n\r\nHe was on of the consultants to the Children's Television Workshop during the planning of “ Sesame Street ” in 1969. In April 1980 he was inducted into the Hall of Fame of the National Association of Sports and Physical Education.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

"Biography":"Edward Bruce (1879-1943) was the director of the Public Works of Art Project (PWAP) and the Section of Painting and Sculpture, two New Deal relief efforts that provided work for artists in the United States during the Great Depression. Bruce had been a successful lawyer and entrepreneur before giving up his career altogether at the age of forty-three to become an artist. However, like most artists during the Depression, he found it impossible to make a living making art, and grudgingly returned to business in 1932 as a lobbyist in Washington for the Calamba Sugar Estate of San Francisco. In 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt received a letter from the American painter George Biddle, who suggested a New Deal program that would hire artists to paint murals in federal office buildings. Roosevelt was intrigued by the idea, and brought the idea to the Treasury Department, which oversaw all construction of federal buildings. Bruce had by that time made some connections in Washington, and he was asked to help organize the effort.\r\n",

Painting full-time by 1929, his works became larger, and he concentrated on realist, urban subjects, such as the industry around Buffalo. In 1936-1937, Fortune magazine commissioned Burchfield to paint railway yards and coal mines. During his later period, from 1943-1967, his works became more expressionist, evoking his pantheist beliefs (ULAN).",

"Biography":"Archaeologist and Professor of the History of Architecture, was first Master in Residence of the Graduate College and first director of the School of Architecture. In his early student days he played leading roles in the first productions of the newly founded Triangle Club and helped organize the college's third eating club, Tiger Inn, whose clubhouse he later designed. In his senior year, under the influence of Professor Allan Marquand, he acquired a serious interest in the history of art, which he further developed in graduate study at Princeton, the Columbia School of Architecture, the American Academy in Rome, and the American School of Classical Study at Athens. He organized and led three archaeological expeditions into the Syrian Desert and two expeditions for the excavation of ancient Sardis, discovering there long-hidden treasures that enriched modern knowledge of Lydian, Greek, Syrian, and Roman civilizations. The diplomatic skill and the personal courage Butler demonstrated on these expeditions were legendary. Professor Marquand told of Butler's braving the Bedouins of the Syrian desert, unsupported by the guards usually considered necessary, and of how, on another occasion, when all the others had run to their quarters for firearms, Butler, unassisted and armed only with a bamboo cane, quelled an insurrection among the natives at Sardis. ``His tact and personal bravery . . . invested his expeditions with the charm of romance'' which was carried over into his teaching, where he also demonstrated ``a subtle instinct for divining and evoking the latent powers of those he taught.'' \r\nAs Master in Residence, first at the experimental graduate hall ``Merwick'' and then at the Graduate College itself, his serenity, self-discipline, and intellectual integrity exerted an influence attested to by many of the graduate students of that era. \r\nAs Professor of Architecture, ``he stood almost alone,'' in Professor Marquand's words, ``in transcending his subject and in revealing it against its broad and deep historic background both as complete in itself and as an organic part of human achievement.'' His teaching inspired a group of alumni architects to initiate a movement that re~sulted in th~e establishment of the School of Architecture in 1920, with Butler as first director. \r\n``If we were to ask for a motto for his life,'' said Dean West, ``I think the saying of an old Italian scholar would be most fi~tting: `I go to wake the dead.' Professor Butler did wake the dead -- dead impulses in students to newness of life, dead cities of the Orient rising again under his magical touch.'' \r\nA portrait of Butler hangs in Procter Hall in the Graduate College and the following inscription, discovered on a Christian tomb in northern Syria by his first expedition, appears in his memory on a stone in the vestibule: ``I sojourned well; I journeyed well; and well I lie at rest. Pray for me.'' His name is perpetuated by a professorship in the history of architecture created in 1931 by gifts from his former students. \r\nFrom Alexander Leitch, A Princeton Companion, copyright Princeton University Press (1978).\r\n",

In the 1940s, becoming interested in expanding the range of percussive instruments, he developed the \"prepared piano\", composing works for a piano with various objects placed between the strings. After studying Zen Buddhism, Cage began to work toward a new theory of composition, focusing on removing intention and personal taste, with attention paid to the process and the element of chance. Regarding silence on equal terms as structured sound and noise, in 1952 Cage produced 4'33\", a composition in which no sound is made. Cage was a strong influence and a collaborator with many visual artists. American composer (ULAN).",

In the 1920s, Calder began traveling to Paris, becoming influenced by the work of Klee and Miró. In 1930, after visiting Piet Mondrian's studio, he began to create abstract constructions incorporating biomorphic forms, specifically with variations on the mobile, for which he is most known. Calder divided his time between trips abroad and his farm in Roxbury, Connecticut, and as his commissions grew more frequent, his mobiles became increasingly gigantic. Examples are Flamingo, the stabile at Federal Center Plaza in Chicago, and La Défense, at the Rond Point de La Défense Métro station in Paris. American artist (ULAN).",

He was the son of sculptor Alexander Milne Calder and the father of sculptor Alexander (Sandy) Calder.\r\n\r\nIn 1885 at age 16, A.S. Calder attended the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts where he studied under the renowned Thomas Eakins. He first worked as a sculptor the following year, assisting his father in producing the extensive sculpture program on the Philadelphia City Hall, and is reported to have modeled the arm of one of the figures. In 1890 Calder moved to Paris where he studied at the Academie Julian under Henri Michel Chapu, and then was accepted in the Ecole des Beaux-Arts where he entered the atelier of Alexandre Falguière. In 1902 he returned to Philadelphia and began his career as a sculptor in earnest. Throughout his career Calder was frequently a teacher, variously teaching sculpture or anatomy at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, the Pennsylvania Museum School of Industrial Art in Philadelphia, the National Academy of Design in NYC and the Art Students League of New York.\r\n\r\nIn 1912, Calder, along with Karl Bitter, was named head of the sculpture program for the Panama-Pacific Exposition in San Francisco in 1915. Calder obtained a studio in NYC and there employed the services of model Audrey Munson who posed for Calder and a host of other artists.\r\n\r\nHe is buried in West Laurel Hill Cemetery in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania.

"Biography":"Known for his tonalist nature paintings, especially snow scenes, in conservative style, John Carlson was one of the leading landscape painters in America in the early 20th century. He founded the John F Carlson School of Landscape painting in Woodstock, New York, and in 1942, co-founded with Emile Gruppe a summer school in Gloucester. He was a proponent of juxtaposing light and shadow to capture the changing moods of nature.\r\n\r\nHe spent his childhood in Kalmar-Lan, Sweden and immigrated at age 10 with his family to Brooklyn, New York and later to Buffalo. His father, encouraging his son's art talent, hired a private tutor, and he later attended the Buffalo Albright Art School where his teacher was Lucius Hitchcock. In 1902, he enrolled on a scholarship at the Art Students League in New York City, and his teachers were Frank Vincent DuMond and Birge Harrison. He and Harrison became very close friends, and Carlson joined his teacher at Woodstock but decided he did not like the regimentation.\r\n\r\nHowever, in 1906, he returned to Woodstock as Harrison's assistant, and also became active in the Arts and Crafts Movement at Woodstock as part of the Byrdcliffe Colony. In 1909, he had his first one-man show in New York City. In 1911, he was elected to the National Academy of Design and made a full academician in 1925 and until 1916, became director of the Art Students League summer school.\r\n\r\nAfter traveling extensively in the United States, he returned to Woodstock and founded his own school. He also helped found the Broadmoor Art Academy in Colorado Springs and painted frequently in the Canadian Rockies and Gloucester, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nSource:\r\nDavid Zellman, \"300 Years of American Art\r\nPeter Falk, \"Who Was Who in American Art\"\r\nhttp:\/\/www.museum.cornell.edu\/byrdcliffe\/\r\n",

"Biography":"Horace Thompson Carpenter, who was born 1857 in Monroe, Michigan and died 1947 in Bala, suburban Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was a descendant of Samuel Carpenter, a close associate of William Penn, the founder of Pennsylvania. Educated at the Episcopal Academy of Philadelphia, the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts (studied under Thomas Eakins), Philadelphia School of Industrial Art and the New York Art Students League, Horace T. Carpenter had an early career in engineering, writing, and illustration. \r\n\r\nHe was active in several art media. Among his earliest attributed works are illustrations for books by Hamlin Garland, \"Main-Travelled Roads\" (1893) and \"Prairie Songs\" (1893), and illustration of the 1897 issue of \"The Chap Book.\" In 1904-1905 and 1906-1907, he was listed in Turner's \"Hudson River Directory\" as a resident of Tarrytown, NY, at which time he was art editor for \"Cosmopolitan\" magazine. \r\n\r\nCarpenter is known to havefilled three sketchbooks while a guest of the American novelist Francis Marion Crawford in Rome in 1904. A number of these sketches were of Mr. Crawford; Italian sculptor Gaetano Chiaromonte; American artist Elihu Vedder and well-known scenes of interest around Rome. He painted derivative works of notable personnel of Dickinson College in Carlisle, PA, and historical paintings for private clients and patrons in New York and Delaware. \r\n\r\nHe illustrated books for several well-known American authors, including Mary Harriott Norris' \"The Grapes of Wrath, a Tale of North and South\" (1901); Neith Boyce's \"The Folly of Others\" (1904); F. Marion Crawford's \"Whosoever Shall Offend\" (1904) and \"Fair Margaret\" (1905); William Johnston's and Paul West's \"The Innocent Murderers\" (1910); prominent financier and political activist John Jakob Raskob's \"The Raskob-Green Record Book\" (1921), and undoubtedly others. \r\n\r\nHe was a member of The Players Club in New York City (founded in 1888 by Shakespearean actor Edwin Booth, brother of John Wilkes Booth), a gathering place for actors and eminent men in other professions. He served as superintendent and then curator of Independence Hall (now Independence National Historical Park) in Philadelphia from 1916 to 1946, shortly before his death at age 89. His work and association with many prominent personages of his day make him a figure of remarkable interest to historians.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n** If you discover credit omissions or have additional information to add, please let us know at registrar@AskART.com \r\n",

"Biography":"Giuseppe Ceracchi (also known as Giuseppe Cirachi[1]) (4 July 1751[2] – 30 January 1801) was an Italian sculptor, active in a Neoclassic style in Italy, England and the nascent United States, who was a passionate republican during the American and French revolutions.[3] He is remembered for his portrait busts of prominent British and American individuals.\r\n\r\nHe initially trained in Rome with Tommaso Righi (1727–1802) and then continued his studies at the Accademia di San Luca. He went to London in 1773, armed with a letter of introduction from Matthew Nulty, an English antiquarian and amateur sculptor in Rome,[4] and worked under Agostino Carlini, a founding member of the Royal Academy.[5] Living in Carlini's lodgings near Soho Square,[6] Ceracchi modelled architectural ornament and bas-relief panels for Robert Adam,[7] most notably a grand bas-relief of a Sacrifice to Bacchus, fourteen feet long and six feet high, in Adam's patent mastic composition, for the rear façade of Mr. Desenfans' house in Portland Place.[8] In 1778, Ceracchi sculpted the statues of Temperance and Fortitude cast in Portland stone for the Strand façade of Sir William Chambers' Somerset House, London;[9] Carlini, who modelled the other two classical virtues for the project, was occupied with architectural sculpture for Somerset House over several years and doubtless recommended Ceracchi. As well as the portrait busts he executed in London is a full-length portrait of Anne Seymour Damer, herself a sculptor and to some extent his pupil,[10] in antique robes, with her tools at her feet (British Museum).[11]\r\n\r\nHe made two visits to the new American republic, in 1790–2, in hopes of being commissioned to erect an extremely elaborate monument to the new Republic and George Washington that he was convinced Congress had voted, and again in 1794–5, when he was disappointed in raising the funds for his venture by private subscription. Of this unrealizable project for a bombastic marble allegory James Madison drily remarked that the sculptor \"was an enthusiastic worshipper of Liberty and Fame, and his whole soul was bent on securing the latter by rearing a monument to the former\".[12] Duplicate letters from Ceracchi to Washington and George Clinton[13] describe plans for a national monument to Washington to be built in the newly planned capital city.\r\n\r\nDuring his two American visits he executed heroic portrait busts[14] of leaders of the American Revolution, including Benjamin Franklin (Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts), John Jay (Supreme Court, Washington DC), Thomas Jefferson (Monticello),[15] George Washington with a Roman haircut and a toga (Metropolitan Museum of Art[16]), George Clinton, again presented as a noble Roman (twice, Boston Atheneum and New-York Historical Society), Alexander Hamilton (New York Public Library[17]). Most of his prominent subjects sat to him to encourage his art, but none could be found to pay for their busts after the fact. Washington politely refused the gift of his Roman bust in colossal size, in plaster.[18]\r\n\r\nHe returned to Florence about 1794. In Rome he entered with fiery vehemence into the projected Italian Republic under revolutionary French auspices, when Joseph Bonaparte arrived in the city in 1797, drawing Jacobin sympathizers to him. In the Jacobin riots of December 1797, during which brigadier-general Mathurin-Léonard Duphot was killed, Ceracchi was noted as a leader of the rioters;[19] events led directly from Duphot's death to the Directoire’s decision to occupy the city. French troops arrived on 10 February 1798 and on the 15th the Republic of Rome was proclaimed. In 1799 Ceracchi moved to Paris, where he sculpted the portrait bust of Pope Pius VI (Residenzmuseum, Munich; Palazzo Bianco, Genoa). Having sculpted a bust of Napoleon Bonaparte (Museum at Nantes), he became disillusioned after the coup d'état of 18 Brumaire to the extent that he was embroiled in the paranoid and furious reaction of Napoleon to the plot of the Rue Saint-Nicaise, an attempt against Napoleon's life in which a machine infernal was exploded, with loss of innocent life; Ceracchi was arrested with other outspoken Jacobins 8 January and guillotined 30 January 1801, \"going to the scaffold, it is said, in a triumphal chariot of his own design\".[20]\r\n\r\n\r\n[edit] Notes\r\n^ The terracotta model for his bust of Sir Joshua Reynolds (Burlington House) is signed Cirachi (Rupert Gunnis, Dictionary of British Sculptors 1660-1851, s.v. \"Ceracchi, or Cirachi, Joseph\", rev. ed. 1968). \r\n^ The unfounded tradition that he was born in Corsica may stem from the portrait bust he exhibited at the Royal Academy of Pasquale Paoli, the Corsican patriot and founder of a short-lived republic, the first of modern times. \r\n^ A commemorative exhibition at the Palazzo dei Conservator, Rome, 1989, was titled \"Giuseppe Ceracchi: scultore giacobino : 1751-1801\" (\"Giuseppe Ceracchi, Jacobin sculptor\"). \r\n^ William Rieder, \"Piranesi at Gorhambury\" The Burlington Magazine 117 No. 870 (September 1975:582, 584-591) p. 589, notes 25, 26. \r\n^ Ceracchi exhibited busts at the Academy 1776-79 and was proposed for membership but received only four votes (Gunnis 1968). His bust of the Academy's president Sir Joshua Reynolds, is in the collection of the Royal Academy of Art ([http:\/\/www.tate.org.uk\/britain\/exhibitions\/reynolds\/roomguide1.shtm exhibited, \"Reynolds and the self-Portrait\", Tate Gallery 2005). \r\n^ A.T. Smith, Nollekens and His Times (1828, reprinted 1986) vol.

"Biography":"Howard Chandler Christy (January 10, 1873—March 3, 1952) was an American artist famous for the \"Christy Girl\", similar to a \"Gibson Girl\". He painted Scene at the Signing of the Constitution of the United States.\r\n\r\nSome of his work is on display at New York City restaurant Café des Artistes - they include six panels of wood nymphs and paintings such as The Parrot Girl, The Swing Girl, Ponce De Leon, Fall, Spring, and the Fountain of Youth.[1]\r\n\r\nHe was born in Morgan County and attended early school in Duncan Falls, Ohio. He then studied in New York at the National Academy and the Art Students League under William Merritt Chase. He first attracted attention with his illustrations of the Spanish-American War, published in Scribner's and Harper's magazines and in Collier's Weekly, gaining especial prominence with the series, \"Men of the Army and Navy,\" and a portrait of Colonel Roosevelt. He was best known, however, for his charming illustrations of the works of such authors as Richard Harding Davis and he created a picturesque and romantic type of society women peculiarly his own. His work is characterized by great facility, a dashing but not exaggerated style, and a strong sense of values. He preferred black and white, but he also worked with success in color.

"Biography":"Jacob Cist, scientist, was born in Philadelphia, Pa., March 13, 1782; the eldest son of Charles and Mary (Weiss) Cist. He was graduated at the Moravian school, Nazareth, Pa., and was connected with the post office department, Washington, D. C., 1800-08, when he removed to Wilkes Barre, Pa. There he was appointed postmaster and retained the position till his death. He devoted much of his leisure to painting and literature, contributing for years to The Literary Magazine, The Portfolio, and to the local papers of Pennsylvania. He invented and patented a mill to grind colors for paints and in 1808 secured a patent for manufacturing a mineral black for printer's ink from Lehigh anthracite coal, as a substitute for India ink. For many years he was interested in the mining and introduction of anthracite coal, and in 1815 published a pamphlet, \"Anthracite Coal,\" which attracted general attention in the eastern states. He was one of the founders of the Luzerne county agricultural society; was treasurer of that county and also of the Wilkes Barre bridge company for three years. He geologized nearly the entire territory of Luzerne county, locating coal, manganese clay and iron ore. The eminent French scientist Alexander Brongniart named several fossil plants after Mr. Cist, including \"Calamites Cistii,\" \"Pecopteris Cistii,\" \"Sigillavia Cistii,\" and \"Menropteris Cistii.\" He was married Aug. 25, 1807, to Sarah, daughter of Judge Matthias and Mary (Burritt) Hollenback of Wilkes Barre, Pa. He prepared an exhaustive work on American entomology with several thousand original drawings. This work was published by another after the death of Mr. Cist without proper credit being given him. He died at Wilkes Barre, Pa., Dec. 30, 1825.\r\n\r\nSource: \r\n\r\nJohnson, Rossiter, ed.\r\nTwentieth Century Biographical Dictionary of Notable Americans.\r\nVol. I-X.

"Biography":"Although difficult to categorize, Bruce Conner is considered by many to be one of the foremost American artists of the Post-War era. Working in a broad range of media, including film, assemblage, painting, photography, sculpture, drawing, and printmaking, Conner emerged in the San Francisco Bay area art scene in the late 1950s with his witty, conceptually provocative works that touched on themes of Post-War American culture. Known initially for his delicate assemblages and collages assembled from found objects and materials, Conner was perhaps most influential as a leader in the New American Cinema of the 1960s, producing short films edited together from short bits of pre-existing film stock and television broadcasts. \r\n\r\nBy the mid-60s Conner had ceased making films and assemblages in favor of meticulously detailed abstract black and white drawings filled with a multitude of short, uniform strokes from felt-tipped pens. In the words of the artist: “The felt-tip pen drawings came about when I was trying to work with pen and ink to create images that had both a positive and negative linear form [that] I wasn’t able to create in brush or pen.”\r\n\r\nHaving realized by the late 1960s that the highly impermanent nature of the inks in the pens he used meant that his drawings were rapidly fading, in 1970 Conner turned to a commercial printer in Oakland, California to reproduce his drawings as offset lithographs printed on fine paper. The precise clarity of the photomechanical printing process added a flat impersonal quality that suited the artist and preserved the crisp pen work of the original drawing, and complimented Conner’s obsessive mark making.",

After meeting Edward Weston, Cunningham joined the pictorialist group of photographers in 1923 and adopted 'straight photography'. During the 1920s she shot her famous group series of plants and flowers. Cunningham was a founding member of the Group f\/64 in San Francisco (ULAN).",

He was twice a member of the U.S. Olympic Rifle Team, and rose to the rank of colonel in the New Jersey National Guard. He is also known for his first ascent of Mount Princeton in 1877.\r\n\r\nHe was born in Jersey City, New Jersey to William Libbey, Jr., a wealthy New York City merchant, and Elizabeth Marsh (Libbey).[1] Libbey graduated from Princeton in 1877 and that summer went on the Princeton scientific expedition to the West. It was there that on the afternoon of July 17, 1877, at 12:30 pm he reached the summit of Mount Princeton.[2] Following his summer in the West, Libbey studied in Berlin and Paris.[3]\r\n\r\nLibbey returned and received his doctorate in geology in 1879, the first awarded by Princeton. In 1880 he was appointed as director of the Elizabeth Marsh Museum of Geology and Archaeology as well as an associate professor to teach physical geography.[1] In 1883 he was appointed as a full professor and continued to teach the physical geography classes.[1]\r\n\r\nIn 1878 Libbey was involved with the controversy concerning whether the Acoma people had once lived on Enchanted Mesa. After great exertion, he spent a couple of hours on the mesa top and concluded that nothing was there and that it had never been occupied. Subsequent work by archaeologists have shown that Libbey's conclusion was hasty.[4]\r\n\r\nAt the 1912 Summer Olympics he won the silver medal as a member of the American team in the team running deer, single shots competition.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nLibbey died in Princeton, New Jersey.

At age 23, he became full professor of mathematics at the university. Six years later, he became university vice president. He was responsible for bringing a number of renown scholars and academics to the college. During this time, he also left mathematics and became professor of ancient languages. Maclean was one of the chief architects of the state's public education system. His plan for a state normal school, local boards of education and nonsectarian public schools was adopted by the state legislature. He became president of the College of New Jersey in 1854. He led the university through the 1855 burning of Nassau Hall and the American Civil War. After retiring from his post after 14 years in office, he wrote a two-volume history of the university. He served as the honorary president of the university's Alumni Association until his death. (Wikipedia)",

"Biography":"Tarkington, [Newton] Booth (1869-1946), novelist and playwright, spent his first two years of college at Purdue, his last two at Princeton. He was a founder of the Triangle Club, and editor of the Nassau Literary Magazine, a contributor of humorous drawings and literary wit to The Tiger, and the most popular man in his class. Bliss Perry said he was ``the only Princeton man who had ever been known to play poker (with his left hand), write a story for the Nassau Lit (with his right hand), and lead the singing in a crowded room, performing these three acts simultaneously.'' These pleasurable activities Tarkington carried on at some expense to his studies, and when his class graduated in 1893 he lacked sufficient credits for a degree. His later achievements, however, won him an honorary A.M. in 1899 and an honorary Litt.D. in 1918. \r\nTarkington's singing of Kipling's ballad, ``The Hanging of Danny Deever'' was a highlight of student life in his time. Sooner or later, when the seniors gathered on the steps of Nassau Hall for their singing, the call would go up ``Tark! Tark! Danny Deever!'' and although he would always protest and suggest another song -- and sometimes even try to slink away -- his classmates would call for him until he had performed. In later years at class reunions the cry continued, and as one of his classmates related in the Alumni Weekly, Tarkington continued to respond reluctantly: \r\n\r\n``The same old Tark -- just watch him shy \r\nLike hunted thing, and hide, if let,\r\nAway behind his cigarette\r\nWhen `Danny Deever!' is the cry. \r\nKeep up the call and, by and by\r\nWe'll make him sing, and find he's yet \r\nThe same old Tark.'' \r\n\r\nTarkington wrote a series of cheerful, realistic novels about life in the Middle West, beginning with The Gentleman from Indiana (1899) and including two Pulitzer Prize winners, The Magnificent Ambersons (1918) and Alice Adams (1921). He also, as Dean West said in presenting him for his second honorary degree, ``rediscovered the American boy and wrote the idyll of his life'' in Penrod (1914) and its sequels. He dramatized several of his novels, wrote other plays, short stories, essays, and The World Does Move (1928), a book of reminiscences . \r\n\r\nIn a commemorative tribute to Tarkington written for the American Academy of Arts and Letters Professor Chauncey B. Tinker of Yale quoted this remark of the critic, Hamilton Basso: \r\n\r\n``In his books as nowhere else, we get an understanding of how that earlier, more stable world of clipped lawns, gabled houses, and long summer holidays seemed from the inside of those who, like Tarkington himself, looked upon it as the best of all possible environments in a none too perfect world.'' \r\n\r\n``In that happy environment,'' Tinker added, ``he had many blessings. Experience of a sadly different kind in later life he bore with fortitude, and remained undefeated to the end. He was a gallant gentleman.'' \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nFrom Alexander Leitch, A Princeton Companion, copyright Princeton University Press (1978). \r\nGo to Search A Princeton Companion \r\n",

"Biography":"Abdalla, Nick (Albuquerque, New Mexico, Born, 1939)\r\n\r\nA contemporary painter, printmaker and sculptor, Nick Abdalla first exhibited on a national level in 1962. He served as Professor of Art at the University of New Mexico from 1968 to 1997 and is currently Professor Emeritus at that institution. Abdalla also served as Director of the Arts & Crafts Complex at Sandia Base (1964-1970) and on the Faculty Senate, City of Albuquerque. Today Nick Abdalla's fine art is included in such public collections as Pomona College Museum of Art and Roswell Museum and Art Center.\r\n  \r\nDuring the 1970's lithography was a major part of Nick Abdalla's artistic oeuvre. He worked closely with the printer and publisher, Tamarind, creating such brilliant lithographs as \"The Good Grey Poet\", \"Super Patriot\", \"The American Way\", and \"Native American\". All were published in small editions of thirty or less. In these works, Nick Abdalla developed a unique, surreal vision of man and his environment.\r\n\r\nSince 1980 Nick Abdalla has concentrated primarily upon sculpture, particularly free-standing constructions derived from materials such as wood, cardboard and netting.\r\n\r\nThe artist biography and information pertaining to this original work of art has been written and designed by Greg & Connie Peters exclusively for \"www.artoftheprint.com\".

"Biography":"American minimalist sculptor whose early work was influenced by Constantin Brancusi, but changed dramatically after he worked on the railway for several years. Andre studied at the Phillips Academy and Kenyon College. In the late 1950s, Andre began creating sculptures, using commercially available materials such as timber, styrofoam, cement blocks, and hay. In addition to being an artist, Andre wrote poetry and was a conductor for the Pennsylvania Railroad. After 1965, his sculptures consisted mainly of 'floor pieces,' consisting of individual units of industrial materials placed directly on the floor in patterns that were inherent to the size and shape of the units themselves. In the 1970s, Andre created many large-scale installations and currently continues to emphasize placement, environment, and materials in his art. American artist, sculptor (ULAN).\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nAmerican sculptor. He attended the Phillips Academy, Andover, MA, from 1951 to 1953, and in 1954 he visited England, where he was greatly impressed by Stonehenge. From 1955 to 1956 he served in the US Army; in 1957 he moved to New York, where he began to write poetry. He also made drawings and sculpture in perspex and wood. He met Frank Stella in 1958 and in 1959 he shared his studio where he made large sculptures, such as Last Ladder (wood, 2.14×1.55×1.55 m; 1959; London, Tate). The Black Paintings on which Stella was working had a considerable influence on André both for their non-referentiality and for their symmetrical and non-hierarchic compositions, in which no part was given more emphasis than any other. André’s totemic wooden sculptures, such as Ladder No. 2 (wood, 2.1×0.15×0.15 m, 1959; London, Tate), are indebted to Constantin Brancusi but were cut rather than carved. Many of them were constructed according to what André called structural building principles, in which elements were stacked and interlocked.\r\n\r\nIn 1965, however, after spending four years working as a freight brakeman and then a conductor on the railway, André abandoned this manner of working and began to look for new materials. ‘The railway completely tore me away from the pretensions of art, even my own, and I was back on the horizontal lines of steel and rust and great masses of coal and material, timber, with all kinds of hides and glue and the burdens and weights of the cars themselves’ (exh. cat. 1978). André’s sculpture after 1965, central to the movement labelled Minimalism, consisted of series of similar units placed together in a manner reminiscent of coupled railway trucks. As each unit is replaceable by another, all units are equally important, thereby obeying the principle of what André called ‘axial symmetry’, where the whole is the same on each side of a central axis.\r\n\r\nAfter 1965 André’s sculptures were made to be placed directly on the floor and were constructed out of common building materials. These included aluminium, lead and magnesium plates, as well as common building bricks, each sculpture comprising one material only, as in 144 Aluminium Squares (1967; Pasadena, CA, Norton Simon Mus.; see fig.). These floor pieces were intended not only to be looked at but also to be walked on, so that the material difference between the floor and the sculpture could be physically experienced. In terms of structure these works were composed simply by placing the elements alongside each other in shapes that were suggested by the elements themselves. Thus the configuration of a work was to a great extent self-determined and logical. The structure of the sculpture would be immediately apparent. In this sense André was concerned to retain the identity of each of his building materials in a way that he had not been earlier by his action of cutting into wood. The artist’s hand would not be visibly apparent.\r\n\r\nSuch sculptures were often meant to be seen not in isolation but in the context of an entire installation that articulated the architecture of the gallery. The titles of individual works such as Equivalent VIII, made of building bricks (1966, destr.; remade 1969; London, Tate), drew attention to the fact that the work was part of a whole just as each work was composed of standard elements. Another characteristic of André’s sculpture after 1965 was its sense of weight and mass, another product of the artist’s experience on the railway. He experimented with sculpture in wood but rejected it as an unsuitably light material for the floor pieces, as he felt that they were likely to move, and that the shape of the sculpture would therefore be difficult to maintain.\r\n\r\nIn the early 1970s André made some major wood sculptures, such as Henge on Threshold (Meditation of the Year 1960) (1971; Otterlo, Kröller-Müller). After 1975 he again began to use wood, but this time as unaltered blocks reminiscent of the sleepers on the railway, as in The Way North, East, South, West (Uncarved Blocks) (western red cedar, 0.91×1.5×1.5 m, 1975; New York, Agnes Gind priv. col.; see 1987 exh. cat., pl. 66).\r\n\r\nFor André a sculpture had no meaning outside of its existence, and for this reason he did not consider himself in any way to be a conceptual artist. The idea cannot be divorced from the object for it must be physically experienced. Its creation arises out of a desire ‘to make something to be in the world’, and its importance lies in the effect it has on its environment and on the viewer’s perception of space (GDA).",

"Biography":"Graves, who has been in the forefront of architectural design for 45 years, began teaching at Princeton in 1962 and retired in 2001. He taught architectural design and theory to thousands of undergraduate and graduate architecture students as well as undergraduate students in other disciplines. \r\n\r\nGraves built an international reputation as an architect and designer whose works -- ranging from office buildings to single-family homes -- have been credited with introducing historical and contextual themes into modern architecture. His designs for furniture and household items, now sold in national retail stores, have helped bring a higher level of design to everyday objects. \r\n\r\nSome of his best-known projects include the Walt Disney Co. corporate headquarters in Burbank, Calif.; the Netherlands' Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport in the Hague; and the much-celebrated interpretive design scaffolding for the Washington Monument Restoration in Washington, D.C. His 1985 creation of the Alessi teapot with a bird spout instantly made him a star on the home design front.\r\n\r\nGraves has won more than 120 other awards and citations, including the National Medal of Arts presented by President Bill Clinton in 1996 for his exceptional achievements in architecture, design and education.\r\n",

"Biography":"Born in 1943, Howardena Pindell is a distinguished African American artist, teacher, and curator whose work is associated with many of the defining movements of postwar art, including abstraction, conceptualism, minimalism, and process art. Through her art and her actions, Pindell has also spent much of her career addressing, deconstructing, and fighting sexism and racism in the art world and the world at large.\r\n\r\nIn her work from the 1970s, Pindell was influenced by an extended trip she took to Kenya, Nigeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast and Senegal in 1973 with Lowry Stokes Sims and by a suite of exhibitions on African art that she saw in New York around the same time (especially an exhibition of African textiles and decorative arts organized by MoMA in 1972-3). As she has written, “African influences came by way of seeing loose hanging textiles, both here and in Africa. I saw nails in nkisi sculpture. I also was aware of a kind of stenciling and sewing together of loose fabrics as well as having a very dense and energetic surface tension in my paintings and works on paper.” The role of accumulation in African art, likewise the flexibility of the systems it so often employs, also informs her work.\r\n\r\nPindell received her MFA from Yale in 1967. She has worked as a professor in the art department at SUNY Stony Brook since 1979. Between 1967 and 1971, she was employed at MOMA, first as a curatorial assistant in the Department of Drawings and Prints, and then as an assistant curator in the Department of Prints and Illustrated Books. She was a founding member of the AIR Gallery, the first women’s cooperative in New York City, and an early member of the Committee against Racism in the Arts, formed in 1979. Pindell has received numerous grants and awards, including the Guggenheim Fellowship, two National Endowment for the Arts grants, and a Joan Mitchell Grant, a Studio Museum in Harlem Artist Award as well as an Anonymous Was a Woman Award and the Most Distinguished Body of Work or Performance Award from the College Art Association.",

It was prevalent in the southeast and mid-continent in the river valleys of what are now the states of Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Arkansas, Missouri, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and parts of Wisconsin, Minnesota and the Great Plains. The culture was based on agricultural development of the bottomlands and government by theocratic village-states. Village architecture is characterized by dwellings arranged around oval or pyramidal earth mounds and a central ceremonial plaza. The style of decorated utilitarian and ceremonial objects is characterized by work in copper, shell, stone, clay, and feathers, often with elaborate designs including human figures, animal motifs, and geometric shapes (AAT).",

They flourished from around 1000 CE to around 1150 CE, hunting, using irrigation for agriculture, and living in compact pueblo-like villages of adobe and masonry. They were probably eventually absorbed by the Pueblo peoples to the north or migrated to Mexico. They are noted for distinctive pottery, which was decorated with imaginative black-on-white designs of insects, animals, birds, and geometric lines. AAT",

"Biography":"David Keister earned his BFA in Printmaking at Ohio University in Athens Ohio. For the next three years, he was a master printer and Shop Manager at Landfall Press in Chicago, Illinois. David then moved to Bloomington Indiana where he received his MFA in Printmaking at Indiana University. In 1980, David and Distinguished Professor of Printmaking Rudy Pozzatti founded Echo Press in Bloomington. For the next 16 years, he worked in collaboration with artists producing many editions of fine art prints. David now lives in Grand Rapids, Michigan and is a Visiting Assistant Professor at Grand Valley State University where he teaches Beginning Printmaking and 2D Design.\r\nDavid Keister was the professional printer and shop manager of Landfall Press in Chicago. He later developed the idea of Echo Press with Rudy Pozzatti and became Echo's master printer and technical director. By tradition, as master printer he received a printer's proof of each edition, and accrued a remarkable body of contemporary prints while at both Landfall Press and Echo Press.\r\nIn 2003, Ann and David Keister chose Grand Valley as the recipient of their vast collection of over 300 prints, an important addition to the university's growing Print and Drawing Cabinet. \r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/normaleditions.illinoisstate.edu\/conferencebio_keister.html\r\n",

"Biography":"Robert Smithson was the father of land art, one of the most important artists of the postwar era, and a central figure in the 'spatial turn' in art. He is also the son of New Jersey. In the late 1960s, Smithson was at the forefront of a movement that radically changed both the form and the location of art: land or environmental art. Among other artists, such as Michael Heizer and Dennis Oppenheim, Smithson abandoned his studio, long the primary site for artistic production, and created art in (and out of) places such as the New Jersey Pinelands and the American Southwest. At such sites, Smithson made landscapes into sculptures and sculptures out of landscapes. These he documented with films, notes, maps, and collections of raw matter--materials he later displayed in galleries and museums. Out of this work emerged a theory that continues to resonate today: the theory of site\/non-site. 'Site' corresponds to an actual place, the place where the work of art was made or where its constituent parts were gathered, while 'non-site' corresponds to the place to which that work is relocated (such as a Manhattan gallery) as well as the form in which it is represented (such as a film or a drawing). The work of art is constituted by the (dialectical) relationship between site and non-site. \r\n\r\nBoth the notion and practice of travel was fundamental to the work Smithson created during his lifetime. Emphatically peripatetic, the artist was made famous by his 1967 travelogue, \"A Tour of the Monuments of the Passaic,\" based on a bus trip he took to Passaic, New Jersey. Throughout his life, Smithson demonstrated a fascination with marginalia, but marginalia understood primarily as a spatial and geographical phenomenon. He was drawn to the periphery of urban, mainstream society, particularly to places (or non-places) that exemplified failure and entropy, such as suburbs and abandoned mines and quarries. Equally important to his work was science fiction and the disciplines of crystallography and geology, of which he was an avid reader. (Kelly Baum)",

"Biography":"Charles J. Fox is a pseudonym for Leo Fox of New York City who made a business of soliciting commissions from leading figures of society, business, and government and furnishing portraits under his pseudonym signature. The portraits were actually painted by Irving Resnikoff (1897-1988), a Russian immigrant artist who executed the paintings from photographs. He had studied art at the Imperial Art Academy in St. Petersburg and immigrated to the United States in 1923. Resnikoff settled in New York City and began a career as a portrait painter, in association with Leo Fox. Phyllis Dillon, wife of the former Secretary, was so pleased with her husband's portrait that she recommended Fox to paint a portrait of John F. Kennedy. A 1965 letter to Fox from Ethel Kennedy expresses her satisfaction with a \"Fox\" portrait of her brother-in-law John, and also praises the Dillon portrait: \"Your portrait of Secretary Dillon is so wonderful --- it just looks as though he is going to get right up from his chair and step over to impart some of the hearty warmth of his glowing personality.\"",

After studying theology, he preached in a Presbyterian pulpit in New York. In 1724, Edwards returned to Yale, where he completed a Masters of Arts Degree and worked as a senior tutor.\r\n\r\nIn 1725. he succeeded his grandfather as pastor of a church in Northampton, Massachusetts. His preachings brought about two revivals, the later came to be known as the Great Awakening. However he alienated many of his congregation by his proposal to depart from his grandfather's policy of encouraging all baptized persons to partake of Communion and instead to admit to this sacrament only those who gave satisfactory evidence of being truly converted. He was dismissed in 1750. He moved to Stockbridge, Massachusetts where he ministered to a tiny congregation and served as missionary to the Housatonic Indians. There, having more time for study and writing.\r\n\r\nEdwards was elected president of Princeton September 29, 1757, five days after the death of his son-in-law, Aaron Burr, Sr., second president of the College. He was a popular choice, for he had been a friend of the College since its inception and was the most eminent American philosopher-theologian of his time. In January 1758, he came to Princeton but died several months later following inoculation for smallpox, and was buried in the President's Lot in the Princeton cemetery beside his son-in-law, Aaron Burr. \r\n\r\n\r\n",

Born in Pequea, Pennsylvania, he had graduated as a valedictorian from the College of New Jersey in 1769, and went on to study theology and philosophy under John Witherspoon, whose daughter he married on 28 June 1775 .In his work, Stanhope Smith expressed progressive views on marriage and egalitarian ideas about race and slavery. The second edition of his Essay on the Causes of Variety of Complexion and Figure in the Human Species (1810) became important as powerful argument against the increasing racism of nineteenth-century ethnology[1]. Stanhope Smith was a staunch monogenist. He opposed the racial classifications of natural historians such as Johann Friedrich Blumenbach, Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, and Carolus Linnaeus[2], and attempted to refute Thomas Jefferson's claim in Notes on the State of Virginia that there were no great black writers or artists[3].\r\n(Wikipedia)\r\n",

He was born in Mendham, New Jersey, and after a religious awakening while at college in Princeton, Dod became affiliated with the influential Princeton Theologians. He published frequently in the group's chief outlet, the Biblical Repertory and Princeton Review, edited by Charles Hodge. Among his publications there, an attack on Transcendentalism (perhaps written with James Waddel Alexander; published in the January 1839 issue) attracted wide notice and was later republished by Andrews Norton. For much of his life he taught mathematics at the College, and participated in theological discussion and preaching at the Seminary, in Princeton. The Doctorate in Divinity, though, was conferred on him by the University of North Carolina and by New York University. Dod died of pleurisy after a brief illness. (Wikipedia 11\/4\/09)\r\n\r\n",

Mole and Thomas spent hours positioning the troops and constructed an enormous tower from which to photograph the arrangement. The \"top\" of these creations could be as far as a quarter mile from the camera, and the final composition only made sense from the camera's pseudo-aerial point of view.\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/www.artic.edu\/aic\/collections\/artwork\/195561?index=0",

A cousin and also a brother-in-law of Joseph Henry, he collaborated with Henry in his scientific investigations at Albany Academy and accompanied him to Princeton in 1832, when Henry became professor of natural philosophy. Appointed tutor in mathematics in 1833 and professor of astronomy in 1840, Alexander's association with the College continued for fifty years. \r\nAlexander gave Princeton's first discrete course in astronomy; he was well liked by his students, who called him ``Stephy.'' The College's first astronomy building, the Halsted Observatory, which stood on University Place from 1869 to 1932, was built through his influence and from his plans; however, a telescope was not installed until after his retirement. Working with only his own small telescope, he carried on a steady program of research, published many papers, and studied comets, including the great comet of 1843, whose sudden appearance excited American interest in astronomy. He also studied the atmospheres of Venus, Mercury, and Jupiter, led expeditions for the Coast and Geodetic Survey and the National Academy of Sciences to observe solar eclipses, and in collaboration with Henry, conducted experiments on the relative heat of sunspots. He was president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1859 and was chosen as one of the original fifty members of the National Academy of Sciences in 1862. \r\n\r\nThe winter before he died, Alexander concluded his astronomical observations of more than half a century by observing the 1882 transit of Venus across the disk of the sun. This phenomenon, not due to occur again until 2004, was well covered from a Princeton point of view, as it was also observed in Princeton by Alexander's immediate successor, Charles A. Young, and in Oyster Bay, New York, by a five-year-old boy named Henry Norris Russell. \r\n\r\nFrom Alexander Leitch, A Princeton Companion, copyright Princeton University Press (1978).",

He subsequently studied in France and Germany, receiving his Ph.D. (on population) from the University of Halle (1894). After appointments at Cornell, Indiana, and Stanford universities, he became professor at Princeton University in 1911.\r\nFetter maintained his European connections, notably with the Austrian economists Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk and Friedrich von Wieser, and was perhaps the leading American exponent of the \"Austrian school,\" with its emphasis upon a structure of economic theory based on psychological assumptions about the subjective behaviour of the maximizing individual. Although Fetter was widely known for his theoretical and practical work on industrial monopoly, his major theoretical contributions involved the development of a capital theory that emphasized time preference rather than physical productivity and a distribution theory based upon a generalization of the rent concept. He was also personally active in social work and was a strong advocate of academic freedom. Fetter was a distinguished historian of economic thought and the father of another distinguished economic historian, Frank Whitson Fetter\r\n",

"Biography":"Stephen Grover Cleveland (March 18, 1837 – June 24, 1908) was both the twenty-second and twenty-fourth President of the United States. Cleveland is the only President to serve two non-consecutive terms (1885–1889 and 1893–1897). He was the winner of the popular vote for President three times—in 1884, 1888, and 1892—and was the only Democrat elected to the Presidency in the era of Republican political domination that lasted from 1860 to 1912. Cleveland's admirers praise him for his honesty, independence, integrity, and commitment to the principles of classical liberalism. As a leader of the Bourbon Democrats, he opposed imperialism, taxes, subsidies and inflationary policies, but as a reformer he also worked against corruption, patronage, and bossism.\r\n\r\nSome of Cleveland's actions caused controversy even within his own party. His intervention in the Pullman Strike of 1894 in order to keep the railroads moving angered labor unions, and his support of the gold standard and opposition to free silver alienated the agrarian wing of the Democrats.Furthermore, critics complained that he had little imagination and seemed overwhelmed by the nation's economic disasters—depressions and strikes—in his second term.Even so, his reputation for honesty and good character survived the troubles of his second term. In the words of his biographer, Allan Nevins, \"in Grover Cleveland the greatness lies in typical rather than unusual qualities. He had no endowments that thousands of men do not have. He possessed honesty, courage, firmness, independence, and common sense. But he possessed them to a degree other men do not.\"(Wikipedia)\r\n\r\n",

"Biography":"Thompson, Henry Burling 1877 (1857-1935) probably had more to do with the physical appearance of Princeton during the period of unprecedented expansion in the Wilson and Hibben administrations than any other man. A textile manufacturer in Wilmington and president of the board of trustees of the University of Delaware, he was a Princeton trustee for almost thirty years. \r\nThompson was chairman of the trustees' committee on grounds and buildings from 1909 to 1928. He early saw the need for the formulation of a master plan for the development of the Campus; he proposed the creation of the offices of supervising architect and consulting landscape gardener, and was influential in bringing Ralph Adams Cram and Beatrix Farrand to Princeton to fill these positions. During his chairmanship, twenty-five campus buildings were erected, beginning with Holder Hall and ending with the University Chapel. \r\n\r\nA friend of Woodrow Wilson since their college days, Thompson supported Wilson's quad plan and graduate college proposals, but when these were defeated and Wilson left to enter politics, he gave the same loyal support to John Grier Hibben. ``He never hesitates, he never draws back,'' President Hibben told Thompson's classmates, ``and when he once puts his mind and spirit to any enterprise for the sake of Princeton, its successful accomplishment is assured.'' \r\n\r\nThompson headed the 1919 drive that raised $10 million in new endowment and helped found the School of Engineering in 1921. He was chairman of a trustees' committee that drew up the University's basic plan of physical education and encouraged the development of a greatly expanded number of tennis courts and playing fields near the dormitories. He spoke out against undue emphasis on gate receipts in intercollegiate athletics and pushed the idea of ``athletics for all.'' He had a special (and partisan) interest in rowing -- he was chairman of the alumni rowing committee for ten years -- and every spring the editor of the Alumni Weekly confidently awaited Thompson's annual letter asking why crew was not given more space. \r\n\r\nThompson is commemorated by a memorial court, created in 1956 with a gift from his family, at the center of the walk that passes through the arches of East Pyne Building, on the site of East College, where he roomed as an undergraduate. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nFrom Alexander Leitch, A Princeton Companion, copyright Princeton University Press (1978).",

"Biography":"Burr, Aaron, Jr. (1756-1836), third vice-president of the United States (1801-1805), was thought to be one of the most brilliant students graduated from Princeton in the eighteenth century. Woodrow Wilson said he had ``genius enough to have made him immortal, and unschooled passion enough to have made him infamous.'' His father was Princeton's second president; his maternal grandfather, Jonathan Edwards, was Princeton's third president. The younger Aaron Burr was left an orphan when he was two years old, his father and mother (and both maternal grandparents) having died within a year. He did not respond well to the discipline of his austere uncle, Timothy Edwards, several times running away from home and attempting to go to sea. He entered the sophomore class at Princeton at the age of thirteen and graduated with distinction at sixteen in 1772, a year after James Madison and Philip Freneau. He was a member of the Cliosophic Society and for his Commencement Oration chose the prophetic topic ``On Castle Building.'' \r\nBurr studied theology for a while and then law. After the Revolutionary War, in which he served with distinction as a field officer, he took up the practice of law in New York City and entered politics, serving as a member of the New York state assembly, attorney general of New York, and United States senator. In the presidential election of 1800, he received the same number of electoral votes as Thomas Jefferson, but the tie was broken in the House of Representatives in Jefferson's favor, and Burr became vice-president. \r\n\r\nFour years later, on July 11, 1804, in the historic duel at Weehawken, New Jersey, Burr mortally wounded his professional rival and political enemy, Alexander Hamilton. Thereafter came his errant political adventures in the West, his trial for treason, and his acquittal. \r\n\r\nBurr's chief counsel at the trial was Luther Martin 1766, a fellow member and one of the founders of the Cliosophic Society. A few years before his death, the society invited Burr to preside at its commencement meeting, and its members took part in the procession at Burr's funeral in Princeton in 1836. President Carnahan preached the funeral sermon in Nassau Hall (in which he decried the evils of dueling). Escorted to the Princeton Cemetery by members of the faculty, students, alumni, a military band, and the Mercer Guards, Burr was buried with full military honors at the foot of his father's and grandfather's graves in the President's Lot. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nFrom Alexander Leitch, A Princeton Companion, copyright Princeton University Press (1978).",

"Biography":"William Richardson Davie (June 22, 1756–November 5, 1820) was the Governor of North Carolina from 1798 to 1799. He was a Federalist and may be considered a \"Founding Father of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nBorn in Egremont Parish, Cumberland County, England, William Davie immigrated to North America in 1764 with his parents, Archibald and Mary Richardson Davie. The family soon established a farmstead in the \"Waxhaws\" region, in present-day Lancaster County, South Carolina. There Mary's brother, William Richardson, had settled earlier and served as a prominent Presbyterian minister. As a youth, William Davie was influenced significantly by his uncle, especially in the years after the death of Davie's mother in 1767. The Reverend Richardson, whose manse was located next to the Davie family's property, provided his nephew with religious instruction and likely with the bulk of the boy's basic secular education at the nearby church school. According to some biographical accounts, Davie traveled to North Carolina at the age of fifteen to acquire higher education at Queen's College in Charlotte. While no period documentation has been found to confirm his studies at that short-lived academy in 1771, records to show that he enrolled at the College of New Jersey (later Princeton University) in 1774.\r\n\r\nWilliam Davie's years at the northern college proved to be decisive ones for him, as they were for New Jersey and the rest of the American colonies, which were moving with increasing speed and resolve to sever their ties permanently with Great Britain. Reports of fiery debates in the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia and of armed, bloody confrontations between rebels and pro-British forces deeply affected Davie, imbuing him and many of his classmates with a growing sense of American nationalism, unified purpose, and with a desire to enter the fight against the crown.\r\n\r\nNews in July 1776 that delegates in Philadelphia had signed the Declaration of Independence finally spurred Davie and a group of his fellow students to act on their emotions. Over the objections of their teachers, they organized at school that summer a volunteer company and marched thirty-seven miles from Princeton to Elizabeth, New Jersey (at the time \"Elizabethtown\"), to join a detachment of General George Washington's army. Apparently, the rigors and tedium of daily life in the military quickly tempered the students' patriotic zeal, for they soon returned to college. Shortly thereafter, in October 1776, Davie completed his coursework at the College of New Jersey and received his bachelor's degree.\r\n\r\n\r\n[edit] Revolutionary and post-Revolutionary Era\r\nAfter leaving New Jersey, Davie began to study law in Salisbury, North Carolina, under Spruce Macay (pronounced \"Muh-coy\"), who would later provide Andrew Jackson with his own legal training. In December 1778, Davie left Salisbury to join 1,200 militiamen led by Brigadier General Allen Jones of Northampton County, NC. Jones's force advanced toward Charleston, SC, with intentions to aid the port city as it prepared its defenses against possible British assault. That threat receded, so Davie and the rest of Jones's men returned to North Carolina after marching as far southward as Camden, SC.\r\n\r\nDavie resumed his studies in Salisbury, but in the spring of 1779, he closed his law books again to reenter military service. This time, though, Davie did not volunteer for an existing force; he helped to raise and train a local cavalry troop. For his work in forming \"a Company of Horse in the District of Salisbury,\" he received a lieutenant's commission in April from North Carolina Governor Richard Caswell. Davie did not remain in that junior rank for long. In May 1779, he and his company were attached to the legion of General Casimir Pulaski, who earlier in the year had moved from Pennsylvania to South Carolina to help bolster American positions in and around Charleston. Promoted to the rank of major under Pulaski, Davie assumed command of a brigade of cavalry. On June 20, 1779, just two days shy of his twenty-third birthday, Davie led a charge against British forces at the Battle of Stono Ferry outside Charleston. He suffered a serious wound to his thigh in that engagement, fell from his horse, and narrowly escaped capture. While convalescing from his injuries, Davie resumed his legal studies back in Salisbury. Soon he completed or \"stood\" his examinations and in November 1779 obtained a license to practice law in South Carolina. In the late spring and summer of the following year, Davie, now fully recovered, formed an independent company of cavalry. He led that mounted force in several actions during the summer of 1780.\r\n\r\nShortly after the Battle of Hanging Rock, Davie received word of a new army moving into South Carolina under General Horatio Gates. At the Battle of Camden on August 16, 1780 Gates was soundly defeated. While the Continentals fought hard, his militia largely fled without much if any of a fight. Gates and what remained of his army fell back into South Carolina. Davie narrowly missed the battle. Instead of retreating north along with Gates and the remnants of the American army, Davie moved south towards the enemy and Camden to recover supply wagons and gather intelligence on enemy movements. In the time between Camden and the Battle of Kings Mountain, in October 1780, Davie's cavalry was the only unbroken corps between the British army and what was left of the Continental forces.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, Davie's most audacious action as a cavalry officer came at the Battle of Charlotte on September, 26, 1780. Ordered to cover the American army retreat and hinder the British invasion of North Carolina, Davie, now a colonel, and 150 of his mounted militia set up defense in what was then the small village of Charlotte. He dismounted several of his men and had them take station behind a stone wall at the summit of a hill in the center of town. Other dismounted soldiers where scattered on the flanks with a reserve of cavalry. At about noon, the British army under General Lord Cornwallis appeared. Cornwallis' forces numbered at least 2,000 Redcoats and loyalists. After three charges of British cavalry and infantry moving on his right flank, Davie and his men retreated northward. Cornwallis subsequently occupied Charlotte, but he remained there less than two weeks, withdrawing his forces from the \"hornets nest\" after receiving news of the defeat of British and loyalist forces by backcountry militia at the Battle of Kings Mountain on October 7, 1780. As Cornwallis's army marched back toward South Carolina, Davie directed his men to shadow and skirmish with enemy units and to disrupt and intercept their communications.\r\n\r\nDavie's military service in the Revolution changed dramatically after December 1780, when General Nathanael Greene arrived in North Carolina to take command of the American army in the \"Southern Department.\" Headquartered in Charlotte, Greene desperately needed more provisions and equipment for his soldiers as he prepared to counter the certain return of Cornwallis to North Carolina. Davie's leadership skills and knowledge of the region's terrain and inhabitants impressed Greene, who in January 1781 persuaded the experienced cavalry officer to relinquish his field command so that he could serve as the army's commissary-general. In that position Davie spent the final stages of the war carrying out the crucial but often thankless tasks of locating, organizing, and transporting supplies for General Greene's ever-needed troops, as well as for North Carolina's militia.\r\n\r\nAfter the war, Davie rose to prominence in North Carolina as a traveling circuit court lawyer and orator. He was elected to the North Carolina House of Commons on multiple occasions from 1786 through 1798. He served as a member of the Constitutional Convention of 1787 (leaving before he could sign the document) and argued for its passage at the North Carolina State Conventions in 1788 and 1789.\r\n\r\nDavie was elected governor of North Carolina by the North Carolina General Assembly in 1798. During his administration, the state settled boundary disputes with South Carolina and Tennessee to the west. He resigned as the state's chief executive when President Adams enlisted him in 1799 to serve on a peace commission to France, where bilateral negotiations resulted in the Convention of 1800.\r\n\r\nDavie remained active in the state militia and in the newly-formed United States Army; he served in the state militia during the 1797 crisis with France (immediately preceding the Quasi-War) and was appointed brigadier general in the Army by President John Adams. After his return to North Carolina, Davie continued to be active in Federalist politics. He ran unsuccessfully for the United States House of Representatives against Willis Alston in the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1804|1804 election]. (Alston, elected as a Federalist in 1798, joined the Democratic Republican Party during the Jefferson administration).\r\n\r\n\r\n[edit] Founding the University of North Carolina\r\nAs a member of the North Carolina General Assembly, Davie sponsored the bill that chartered the University of North Carolina. He is recognized as the university's founder and served on its board of trustees from 1789 to 1807. Davie also received the institution's first honorary degree in 1811, an LL.D., and was given the title \"Father of the University.\" The \"Davie Poplar\" tree on the campus is, as legend has it, where Davie tied his horse in the late 1790s to pick out the site for the Tar Heel state's first university.\r\n\r\n\r\n[edit] Later life\r\nAfter his unsuccessful run for the House of Representatives Davie retired from public life to his estate, Tivoli, in South Carolina. During the 1812 presidential election, Virginia Federalists who refused to support the candidacy of dissident Democratic-Republican DeWitt Clinton against incumbent Democratic-Republican James Madison nominated presidential electors pledged to Rufus King for president and Davie for vice president. This Federalist slate was defeated by a wide margin [1]). During the War of 1812, Davie served in the army as well, but declined an offer from President James Madison to command the American forces.\r\n\r\nDavie was keenly interested in thoroughbred horses. In 1809, he purchased a champion race horse from William Ransom Johnson, a native of North Carolina who was known in American racing circles as \"The Napoleon of the Turf.\" The horse, \"Sir Archy,\" cost Davie the then-staggering sum of $5,000. That price reflected the horse's greatness and his promise as one of the foundation sires in American racing. Nearly a century and a half later, in 1955, as further testament to Sir Archy's standing, the stallion was among the first class of horses inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in Saratoga Springs, New York.\r\n\r\nDavie died at his Tivoli estate in 1820. He was preceded in death by his wife, the former Sarah Jones, whom he married in 1782. Davie is buried at Old Waxhaw Presbyterian Church in South Carolina. Sarah, who died at the age of 39 in 1802, is buried in the Old Colonial Cemetery in Halifax, North Carolina, and was the daughter of Allen Jones (delegate).\r\n\r\nDavie County, North Carolina, established in 1836, is named in his memory.\r\n\r\nWilliam R. Davie Middle School, in Roanoke Rapids, N.C., is named in his memory.\r\n\r\nWilliam R.

"Biography":"Dr. David Hosack (August 31, 1769 – December 22, 1835), a noted physician, botanist, and educator, is perhaps most widely known as the doctor who attended to Alexander Hamilton after Hamilton's deadly duel with Aaron Burr. Born in New York City to parents Alexander and Jane Hosack, David was the first of their seven children. Following the end of the American Revolution, Hosack was sent to New Jersey academies to further his education, first in Newark and then Hackensack. He would go on to attend Columbia University where he began as a student of art, but eventually became fascinated by medicine. Young David would eventually enter into an apprenticeship with Dr. Richard Bayley. While studying under Bayley in early 1788 at New York Hospital, a mob formed outside of the hospital, as the illicit obtainment of cadavers from graveyards left medical teaching scandalous and disliked. After a medical student taunted the crowd by waiving the arm of one of the corpses out of a window at the mob, a riot ensued and Hosack, trying to protect the laboratory, was hit on the head with a heavy stone.\r\n(Wikipedia 10\/2\/08)\r\n",

"Biography":"Bill MacCoy was the record-setting captain of the Princeton baseball team with everything to live for. Then, one week before he was due to receive his wings in the Army Air Force, disaster struck.\r\n\r\nWilliam Logan MacCoy was born in Overbrook, Pennsylvania on April 17, 1920. He was the only son of Mr and Mrs W Logan MacCoy. His father was an affluent lawyer and president of the Provident Trust Company. 1\r\n\r\nMacCoy attended Haverford School where he first began to excel as an athlete. He was the captain of the squash and tennis teams while playing varsity baseball and football. 2\r\n\r\nMacCoy went to Princeton in 1939 to study politics as a preliminary to his planned career as a lawyer. It was in his freshman year that he began his illustrious baseball career. The young outfielder captained the team and won the Leroy Kellog Cup. 3 Interestingly, MacCoy was part of television history that year. On May 17, W2XBS televised the first ever baseball game - a 2-1, 10th winning win for Princeton at Columbia. 4\r\n\r\nBut MacCoy did not limit himself to baseball. He also took up hockey - a sport which was entirely new to him - because \"it was a challenge to him, and offered the closest of competition and teamwork.\" 5\r\n MacCoy became an outstanding hockey player and a member of the varsity team for three years.\r\n\r\nIn 1940, MacCoy switched from the outfield to catcher. He won the Sophomore Cup as the most improved ball player at Princeton and was selected for the Eastern Inter-Collegiate (EIL) All-League team.6 He also had a 16-game hitting streak - an EIL record that stood for 40 years. 7 The 20 year-old spent the summer as warm-up catcher for the Philadelphia Athletics under the watchful eye of the venerable Connie Mack. 8\r\n\r\nIn December 1941, MacCoy married Adele Goodwyn Griffin - a descendant of John Tyler, tenth President of the United States - at Christ Church in Media, Pennsylvania. 9\r\n\r\nMacCoy's senior year was little short of outstanding. The newlywed captained Princeton to an EIL championship with a .452 batting average, scoring winning runs in two decisive extra-inning games against Yale and Harvard. Furthermore, MacCoy was selected for the EIL All-League team and won the Frederick W Kafer Memorial Cup for \"sportsmanship, play and influence in baseball.\" 10\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring his time at Princeton, MacCoy attended ROTC for four years, displaying the same natural ability and those qualities of leadership which made him a standout in athletics. He received his second lieutenant's commission in the Army on June 11, 1942 but transferred to the Army Air Force in August - challenged by the \"self-reliance and skills needed to become a successful pilot.\"11\r\n\r\nMacCoy received his primary flight training at Tulsa, Oklahoma and his basic flight training at Enid Army Air Filed, Oklahoma. He then headed to the twin-engine advance flying school at Pampa Army Air Field in Texas.\r\n\r\nOn June 19, 1943, MacCoy's life came to an abrupt end when the Cessna UC-78C Bobcat he was flying in crashed at Pampa. Bill MacCoy was just a week away from receiving his pilot's wings.\r\n\r\n\"Those of us who knew Bill well have lost a true friend,\" wrote classmate Joseph O Rutter. \"One could not help being completely dominated by him because of his forceful personality. And at the same time one could not help becoming devoted to him because of his affability, quiet humor, kindliness and loyalty. 12\r\n\r\n\r\nMacCoy's loss devastated his family - not least his wife, Adele, who was five months pregnant at the time. Their daughter, Marguerite, was born October 5, 1943, taking her father's middle name - Logan - as her own. 13\r\n\r\nIn 1946, MacCoy's father arranged for a memorial to be built at University Field (now Clarke Field) home of the Princeton baseball team. The MacCoy memorial included a bronze likeness of the young ball player built into a brick wall directly behind homeplate. MacCoy's father also presented new dugouts to the team. 14 The MacCoy Memorial still oversees Princeton baseball.\r\n\r\nIn June 1987, there was a rededication of the MacCoy memorial at Clarke Field. Among the dignitaries in attendance was a Princeton graduate and former commissioner of Major League Baseball, Bowie Kuhn.15\r\n----------------\r\nNotes\r\n1 New York Times, June 21, 1943\r\n2 Princeton Yearbook 1942\r\n3 Princeton Alumni, Weekly March 24, 1944\r\n4 The Golden Years of Broadcasting, Robert Campbell\r\n5 Princeton Alumni, Weekly March 24, 1944\r\n6 Rededication of The MacCoy Memorial at Clarke Field program, June 7, 1987\r\n7 Princeton Athletics website\r\n8 Princetonian, June 7, 1940\r\n9 New York Times, September 14, 1941\r\n10 Princeton Yearbook 1942\r\n11 unidentified press clipping\r\n12 Princetonian Alumni Weekly, September 10, 1943\r\n13 Princetonian Alumni Weekly, March 24, 1944\r\n14 Princetonian, May 10, 1946\r\n15 Rededication of The MacCoy Memorial at Clarke Field program, June 7, 1987\r\n \r\n\r\nAdded July 15, 2006\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2008 Gary Bedingfield (Baseball in Wartime).

"Biography":"BAINBRIDGE, William, naval officer, born in Princeton, New Jersey, 7 May 1774; died in Philadelphia, 28 July 1833. His ancestor, who in 1600 settled in New Jersey, was the son of Sir Arthur Bain-bridge, of Durham County, England. Captain Bainbridge's father was a descendant in the fifth generation from Sir Arthur. William, his fourth son, was distinguished for his adventurous disposition in early youth, and, with a good education, he elected to follow the sea. He entered the merchant marine at the age of fifteen, and at nineteen became commander of a merchant ship. In 1796, while commanding the ship \" Hope,\" on his passage from Bordeaux to the island of St. Thomas, he was attacked by a British schooner of eight guns and thirty men. Bain-bridge returned the fire and kept it up until the schooner struck her colors. The armament or the \"Hope\" consisted of four 9-pounders and nine men. He could have retained the schooner as a prize, but he merely hailed the captain and told him to \"go about his business and report to his masters that if they wanted his ship they must send a greater force to take her, and a more skilful commander.\" This performance gave him a reputation in Philadelphia, and he could have had command of any ship sailing from that, port. On one occasion, when the English razee \"Indefatigable,\" under the command of Sir Edward Pellew, afterward Lord Exmouth, impressed a seaman from on board the\" Hope,\" Bainbridge boarded the first English merchantman he encountered at sea and took out of her the best seaman she had on board ; he then told the British captain that he might report that William Bainbridge had taken one of his majesty's subjects in retaliation for a seaman taken from the American ship \" Hope,\" by Lieut. Norton, of the \" Indefatigable.\" Though this afforded no redress for the original injury, it was designed to show British naval officers that the rights of American citizens, as far as they were entrusted to Captain Bainbridge's care, were not to be molested with impunity. In 1798 Bainbridge married, at the island of St. Bartholomew, Miss Susan Hyleger, daughter of a respectable merchant, and granddaughter of John Hyleger, of Holland, for many years governor of St. Eustatia. On the organization of a navy in 1798, to protect American commerce against French cruisers, his character for bravery and intelligence secured for Bainbridge the command of the schooner \"Retaliation,\" with the rank of lieutenant-commandant. He was soon afterward captured by the French frigates \"Volunteer\" and \"Insurgent,\" but the schooner was returned to Bainbridge by the governor of Guadeloupe, and he proceeded with her to the United States, carrying many American prisoners, for whom, by his tact, he had obtained their liberty. For his services, Bainbridge was pro-rooted to the rank of master-commandant, and given the command of the brig \" Norfolk,\" of eighteen guns. The \"retaliation act\" against French citizens captured on the ocean, in the quasi war with France, passed at that time (1798), was due to Bainbridge's report of the outrages committed on American prisoners in the island of Guadaloupe. The \" Norfolk\" was sent to the West Indies to report to Com. Christopher R. Perry, and performed most important service, capturing the French lugger \" Republican\" and destroying other vessels. As an acknowledgment of these services, the merchants of Havana presented him with a most complimentary letter when he left the station. In Nay, 1800, Bainbridge was ordered to take command of the frigate \"George Washington,\" to carry tribute to the Dey of Algiers. On his arrival at Algiers, much to his disgust, Bainbridge felt obliged to accede to a demand of the Dey to carry presents to Constantinople, and also an ambassador to the Ottoman Porte. A refusal to comply with this demand would have resulted in depredations by the Algerines on American commerce, the American government not having realized the degradation entailed on it by paying tribute so that its merchant ships might pursue their vocations without being boarded by pirates. At Constantinople Bainbridge was received very kindly, and while there he paved the way to the first treaty between the United States and the Porte. Returning, tie arrived off Algiers 21 January 1801, and the Dey did all he could to entice him into his power and force him to return to Constantinople with presents, etc.; but the \"George Washington\" was anchored beyond reach of the guns of the forts, and there remained until the Dey had given a solemn promise (after Moslem fashion) that lie would not require Bainbridge to return. On this occasion Bainbridge had the pleasure of bringing an order from the sultan for the liberation of 400 Maltese, Venetians, and Sicilians, and, on his presenting a firman from the Capudan paeha at Constantinople (a great friend of Bain-bridge), the Dey from that moment treated him with great consideration.\r\n\r\nOn 20 May 1801, Bainbridge was appointed to command the \"Essex,\" forming part of the squadron under Com. Richard Dale, to cruise against the Barbary powers. In 1803 he was employed in superintending the construction of the \"Syren\" and \"Vixen,\" after which, on 20 May he was ordered to command the \" Philadelphia,\" of 44 guns, of Com. Preble's squadron, fitting out to cruise against, Tripolitan corsairs. Bainbridge sailed before the rest of the fleet, and, on his arrival in the Mediterranean, captured the Moorish ship-of-war \"Mesh-boha,\" of 22 guns, for molesting an American vessel. He also recaptured the American brig \"Celica,\" and this seasonable check to Moorish rapacity prevented further depredations upon American commerce by the Moors. On Bainbridge's arrival off Tripoli he gave chase to a Tripolitan corsair and struck oil a rock, by which the \"Philadelphia\" was wrecked, and she was then surrounded by Tripolitan gun-boats and forced to surrender, not being able to use her guns. This happened on I November 1804. The \"Philadelphia\" was floated off the rock by the Tripolitans and carried into the port of Tripoli, where she was afterward burned by Decatur. The first suggestion for destroying the \"Philadelphia\" is said to have been sent to Com. Preble in a letter from Bainbridge while he was a prisoner. Bainbridge and his officers and crew remained prisoners for nineteen months during the Tripolitan war, suffering many privations, and being subjected to all the dangers of the fire from the American fleet. When peace was restored and they obtained their liberty, a court of inquiry was held on Bainbridge, and he was acquitted of all blame for the loss of the \"Philadelphia.\"\r\n\r\nA short time after his return to the United States Bainbridge was ordered to command the navy yard at New York; but his embarrassed circumstances, owing to his long captivity, obliged him to obtain a furlough and once more enter the merchant service, where he continued until 1808. In anticipation of a war with England he was ordered back to the service in March 1808, and in December was placed in command of the frigate \"President,\" in which he sailed on a cruise in the following year. No war occurring, he again obtained a furlough, and proceeded on a voyage in a merchant ship to St. Petersburg. He continued in the merchant service until 1811, when, hearing that an engagement had taken place between the \"President\" and the British ship-of-war \"Little Belt,\" he left his ship at St. Petersburg and returned to the United States, In anticipation of the war with Great Britain the government had determined to lay up all the ships of the navy in ordinary; but, owing to the representations of Capts. Bainbridge and Stewart, this idea was abandoned. Bainbridge was now ordered to command the Charlestown navy yard; but on the declaration of war, 8 June 1812, he solicited the command of a frigate, and his request was complied with by giving him command not only of the \"Constitution,\" but of the frigate \"Essex,\" Captain David Porter, and the sloop \"Hornet,\" Captain James Lawrence. Bainbridge took the \"Constitution\" immediately after Hull arrived in her from his victory over the \"Guerriere.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Constitution\" parted company with the \"Hornet \" off St. Salvador on 26 December 1812, and three days later fell in with the British frigate \"Java,\" of 49 guns and upward of 400 men. After an action of one hour and fifty-five minutes the \"Java\" surrendered, having been completely dismantled and not having a single spar standing. Her loss was 60 killed and 101 wounded, while the \"Constitution\" lost but 9 killed and 25 wounded. Among the latter was Com. Bainbridge, who was struck twice during the engagement. The \"Java\" was blown up after the prisoners were removed. In his treatment of the prisoners Bainbridge was most magnanimous, and he received many acknowledge-merits for his kindness. On his return to the United States he was received with high honors and ordered to command the Charlestown navy yard, where he laid the keel of the line-of-battle-ship \"Independence.\" No squadron of equal strength ever sailed from any country and accomplished the results that the three historic vessels of Com. Bainbridge's command, the \"Constitution,\" \"Essex,\" and \"Hornet\" realized.\r\n\r\nWhile Bainbridge was in command at Charles-town the British blockaded Boston harbor, and his views for the defense of that port encountered great opposition. Politics ran high, and the opposition party was indifferent with regard to the public property, which they said belonged to the administration, while the commodore insisted that it belonged to the nation and should be protected at all hazards. The governor and council of Massachusetts appointed a committee to consult with Bainbridge, and, on its presuming to dictate to him, he informed it that he should defend his command to the last extremity, let the consequences be what they might, and that if the citizens of Boston chose to make their interests separate from those of the nation, the terrible consequences might fall where they deserved; to him, duty and honor dictated the course he should pursue. Great diversity of opinion existed in Massachusetts with regard to defending the harbors along the coast, and even Boston itself; but, owing to Bainbridge's patriotic importunities and devoted zeal as an officer, sustained as he was by many eminent citizens of Boston, a proper system of defense was adopted and the danger was averted.\r\n\r\nCom. Bainbridge was the first that advocated a board of commissioners for the navy. His long experience in naval concerns satisfied him that the administration of the navy could never be wisely conducted without a preponderance of professional men in connection and working in accord with the civil element. Shortly after the beginning of the war with Great Britain, war was declared against the United States by Algiers, and on the conclusion of peace with Great Britain congress declared war against the regency of Algiers and fitted out a large squadron under the command of Bainbridge, in 1815, to protect American commerce in the Mediterranean. Peace was soon settled honorably by Decatur, and at the same time Bainbridge brought the Bashaw of Tripoli to a sense of the resources of the United States, and exhibited his large force in all the ports. The only way in which peace could be maintained with these people, so faithless in regard to political obligations, was by operating on their fears. After making the necessary arrangements for the protection of American commerce in the Mediterranean, Bainbridge returned to the United States on 15 November 1815. A month later the commodore established the first naval school (in the Boston yard) for officers, and in 1817 he was appointed one of a board to locate navy yards. In October 1819, the first board convened for the examination of young officers for promotion that had ever been assembled in the United States, under Bainbridge as presiding officer. In November of the same year he was ordered to the command of the new line-of-battle-ship \"Columbus,\" and appointed to command the Mediterranean squadron. On his return to the United States after his cruise in 1821, he was ordered to the Philadelphia station, where his professional abilities were brought into play in fitting out the ship-of-the-line \"North Carolina.\" In 1823 he was changed to the command of the Boston station, and soon afterward was appointed naval commissioner.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the difficulty between Decatur and Barron, Bainbridge was in Washington City, and acted as Decatur's second in the duel that led to his death and to Barton's being severely wounded. After severing his connection with the board of commissioners, Com. Bainbridge commanded several navy yards, until in the latter part of his life he became a great sufferer from physical troubles. In 1833 he was attacked by pneumonia, and died on 28 July of that year. His remains were interred in Christ Church burying-ground, in Philadelphia. Coin. Bainbridge was a model of a naval officer, lie was six feet. in height, and had a finely molded and muscular frame, which enabled him to endure any amount of fatigue. His complexion was rather fair, his beard dark and strong, his eyes black, animated, and expressive. His deportment was commanding, his dress always neat; his temperament was ardent and somewhat impetuous, though he could qualify it with the greatest courtesy and the most attractive amenity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEdited Appletons Encyclopedia, Copyright © 2001 VirtualologyTM",

Though there were two papers in the city before James's Courant, they only reprinted news from abroad. James's paper carried articles, opinion pieces written by James's friends, advertisements, and news of ship schedules.\r\n\r\nBenjamin wanted to write for the paper too, but he knew that James would never let him. After all, Benjamin was just a lowly apprentice. So Ben began writing letters at night and signing them with the name of a fictional widow, Silence Dogood. Dogood was filled with advice and very critical of the world around her, particularly concerning the issue of how women were treated. Ben would sneak the letters under the print shop door at night so no one knew who was writing the pieces. They were a smash hit, and everyone wanted to know who was the real \"Silence Dogood.\"\r\n\r\nAfter 16 letters, Ben confessed that he had been writing the letters all along. While James's friends thought Ben was quite precocious and funny, James scolded his brother and was very jealous of the attention paid to him.\r\n\r\nBefore long the Franklins found themselves at odds with Boston's powerful Puritan preachers, the Mathers. Smallpox was a deadly disease in those times, and the Mathers supported inoculation; the Franklins' believed inoculation only made people sicker. And while most Bostonians agreed with the Franklins, they did not like the way James made fun of the clergy, during the debate. Ultimately, James was thrown in jail for his views, and Benjamin was left to run the paper for several issues.\r\n\r\nUpon release from jail, James was not grateful to Ben for keeping the paper going. Instead he kept harassing his younger brother and administering beatings from time to time. Ben could not take it and decided to run away in 1723.\r\n\r\nEscape to Philadelphia\r\n\r\nRunning away was illegal. In early America, people all had to have a place in society and runaways did not fit in anywhere. Regardless Ben took a boat to New York where he hoped to find work as a printer. He didn't, and walked across New Jersey, finally arriving in Philadelphia via a boat ride. After debarking, he used the last of his money to buy some rolls. He was wet, disheveled, and messy when his future wife, Deborah Read, saw him on that day, October, 6, 1723. She thought him odd-looking, never dreaming that seven years later they would be married.\r\n\r\nFranklin found work as an apprentice printer. He did so well that the governor of Pennsylvania promised to set him up in business for himself if young Franklin would just go to London to buy fonts and printing equipment. Franklin did go to London, but the governor reneged on his promise and Benjamin was forced to spend several months in England doing print work.\r\n\r\nBenjamin had been living with the Read family before he left for London. Deborah Read, the very same girl who had seen young Benjamin arrive in Philadelphia, started talking marriage, with the young printer. But Ben did not think he was ready. While he was gone, she married another man.\r\n\r\nUpon returning to Philadelphia, Franklin tried his hand at helping to run a shop, but soon went back to being a printer's helper. Franklin was a better printer than the man he was working for, so he borrowed some money and set himself up in the printing business. Franklin seemed to work all the time, and the citizens of Philadelphia began to notice the diligent young businessman. Soon he began getting the contract to do government jobs and started thriving in business.\r\n\r\nIn 1728, Benjamin fathered a child named William. The mother of William is not known. However, in 1730 Benjamin married his childhood sweetheart, Deborah Read. Deborah's husband had run off, and now she was able to marry.\r\n\r\nIn addition to running a print shop, the Franklins also ran their own store at this time, with Deborah selling everything from soap to fabric. Ben also ran a book store. They were quite enterprising.\r\n\r\nThe Pennsylvania Gazette\r\nIn 1729, Benjamin Franklin bought a newspaper, the Pennsylvania Gazette. Franklin not only printed the paper, but often contributed pieces to the paper under aliases. His newspaper soon became the most successful in the colonies. This newspaper, among other firsts, would print the first political cartoon, authored by Ben himself.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1720s and 1730s, the side of Franklin devoted to public good started to show itself. He organized the Junto, a young working-man's group dedicated to self- and-civic improvement. He joined the Masons. He was a very busy man socially.\r\n\r\nPoor Richard's Almanack\r\nBut Franklin thrived on work. In 1733 he started publishing Poor Richard's Almanack. Almanacs of the era were printed annually, and contained things like weather reports, recipes, predictions and homilies. Franklin published his almanac under the guise of a man named Richard Saunders, a poor man who needed money to take care of his carping wife. What distinguished Franklin's almanac were his witty aphorisms and lively writing. Many of the famous phrases associated with Franklin, such as, \"A penny saved is a penny earned\" come from Poor Richard.\r\n\r\n\r\nFire Prevention\r\nFranklin continued his civic contributions during the 1730s and 1740s. He helped launch projects to pave, clean and light Philadelphia's streets. He started agitating for environmental clean up. Among the chief accomplishments of Franklin in this era was helping to launch the Library Company in 1731. During this time books were scarce and expensive. Franklin recognized that by pooling together resources, members could afford to buy books from England. Thus was born the nation's first subscription library. In 1743, he helped to launch the American Philosophical Society, the first learned society in America. Recognizing that the city needed better help in treating the sick, Franklin brought together a group who formed the Pennsylvania Hospital in 1751. The Library Company, Philosophical Society, and Pennsylvania Hospital are all in existence today.\r\n\r\nFires were very dangerous threat to Philadelphians, so Franklin set about trying to remedy the situation. In 1736, he organized Philadelphia's Union Fire Company, the first in the city. His famous saying, \"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,\" was actually fire-fighting advice.\r\n\r\nThose who suffered fire damage to their homes often suffered irreversible economic loss. So, in 1752, Franklin helped to found the Philadelphia Contribution for Insurance Against Loss by Fire. Those with insurance policies were not wiped out financially. The Contributionship is still in business today.\r\n\r\nElectricity\r\nFranklin's printing business was thriving in this 1730s and 1740s. He also started setting up franchise printing partnerships in other cities. By 1749 he retired from business and started concentrating on science, experiments, and inventions. This was nothing new to Franklin. In 1743, he had already invented a heat-efficient stove — called the Franklin stove — to help warm houses efficiently. As the stove was invented to help improve society, he refused to take out a patent.\r\n\r\nAmong Franklin's other inventions are swim fins, the glass armonica (a musical instrument) and bifocals.\r\n\r\nIn the early 1750's he turned to the study of electricity. His observations, including his kite experiment which verified the nature of electricity and lightning brought Franklin international fame.\r\n\r\nThe Political Scene\r\nPolitics became more of an active interest for Franklin in the 1750s. In 1757, he went to England to represent Pennsylvania in its fight with the descendants of the Penn family over who should represent the Colony. He remained in England to 1775, as a Colonial representative not only of Pennsylvania, but of Georgia, New Jersey and Massachusetts as well.\r\n\r\nEarly in his time abroad, Franklin considered himself a loyal Englishman. England had many of the amenities that America lacked. The country also had fine thinkers, theater, witty conversation — things in short supply in America. He kept asking Deborah to come visit him in England. He had thoughts of staying there permanently, but she was afraid of traveling by ship.\r\n\r\nIn 1765, Franklin was caught by surprise by America's overwhelming opposition to the Stamp Act. His testimony before Parliament helped persuade the members to repeal the law. He started wondering if America should break free of England. Franklin, though he had many friends in England, was growing sick of the corruption he saw all around him in politics and royal circles. Franklin, who had proposed a plan for united colonies in 1754, now would earnestly start working toward that goal.\r\n\r\nFranklin's big break with England occurred in the \"Hutchinson Affair.\" Thomas Hutchinson was an English-appointed governor of Massachusetts. Although he pretended to take the side of the people of Massachusetts in their complaints against England, he was actually still working for the King. Franklin got a hold of some letters in which Hutchinson called for \"an abridgment of what are called English Liberties\" in America. He sent the letters to America where much of the population was outraged. After leaking the letters Franklin was called to Whitehall, the English Foreign Ministry, where he was condemned in public.\r\n\r\nA New Nation\r\nFranklin came home.\r\n\r\nHe started working actively for Independence. He naturally thought his son William, now the Royal governor of New Jersey, would agree with his views. William did not. William remained a Loyal Englishman. This caused a rift between father and son which was never healed.\r\n\r\nFranklin was elected to the Second Continental Congress and worked on a committee of five that helped to draft the Declaration of Independence. Though much of the writing is Thomas Jefferson's, much of the contribution is Franklin's. In 1776 Franklin signed the Declaration, and afterward sailed to France as an ambassador to the Court of Louis XVI.\r\n\r\nThe French loved Franklin. He was the man who had tamed lightning, the humble American who dressed like a backwoodsman but was a match for any wit in the world. He spoke French, though stutteringly. He was a favorite of the ladies. Several years earlier his wife Deborah had died, and Benjamin was now a notorious flirt.\r\n\r\nIn part via Franklin's popularity, the government of France signed a Treaty of Alliance with the Americans in 1778. Franklin also helped secure loans and persuade the French they were doing the right thing. Franklin was on hand to sign the Treaty of Paris in 1783, after the Americans had won the Revolution.\r\n\r\nNow a man in his late seventies, Franklin returned to America. He became President of the Executive Council of Pennsylvania. He served as a delegate to the Constitutional Convention and signed the Constitution. One of his last public acts was writing an anti-slavery treatise in 1789.\r\n\r\nFranklin died on April 17, 1790 at the age of 84. 20,000 people attended the funeral of the man who was called, \"the harmonious human multitude.\"\r\n\r\nHis electric personality, however, still lights the world.\r\n\r\nTEMPLE'S DIARY | QUICK BIO | TIMELINE | KITE | \"BEN SHOW\" | FRANKLIN'S PHILLY | QUOTES | PIC GALLERY | FRANKLIN COURT | AUTOBIOGRAPHY | BIOGRAPHY | COURANT | ESSAYS | FUN AND GAMES | THIS PROJECT | LINKS | GUEST BOOK \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Electric Franklin Home Page\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

"Biography":"Annis Boudinot Stockton (July 1, 1736 – February 6, 1801) was born in Darby, Pennsylvania, to Elias Boudinot, merchant and silversmith, and Catherine Williams. Annis was also known as the Duchess of Morven –- their estate in Princeton, New Jersey was named Morven, after the legendary Scottish King Fingal’s home. She is best known as the wife of Declaration of Independence signer Richard Stockton, but she was also one of America's first female published poets and the writer over 120 works. In 1995 her poems were collected and published in Only for the Eye of a Friend: The Poems of Annis Boudinot Stockton, [1] by Carla Mulford. She was a patriot in her own right and was the only woman made an honorary member of the American Whig Society for her service during the revolutionary war. She wrote both poems and letters to George Washington; a reply may be seen at The Papers of George Washington. Her brother was Elias Boudinot, a statesman from New Jersey. Elias was married to Richard Stockton's sister Hannah. Elias Boudinot was President of the Continental Congress in 1782-1783 and a signer of the Treaty of Paris ending the Revolutionary War.\r\n\r\n",

"Biography":"For half a century she was the most important woman in the social circles of America. To this day she remains one of the best known and best loved ladies of the White House--though often referred to, mistakenly, as Dorothy or Dorothea.\r\n\r\nShe always called herself Dolley, and by that name the New Garden Monthly Meeting of the Society of Friends, in Piedmont, North Carolina, recorded her birth to John and Mary Coles Payne, settlers from Virginia. In 1769 John Payne took his family back to his home colony, and in 1783 he moved them to Philadelphia, city of the Quakers. Dolley grew up in the strict discipline of the Society, but nothing muted her happy personality and her warm heart.\r\n\r\nJohn Todd, Jr., a lawyer, exchanged marriage vows with Dolley in 1790. Just three years later he died in a yellow-fever epidemic, leaving his wife with a small son.\r\n\r\nBy this time Philadelphia had become the capital city. With her charm and her laughing blue eyes, fair skin, and black curls, the young widow attracted distinguished attention. Before long Dolley was reporting to her best friend that \"the great little Madison has asked...to see me this evening.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough Representative James Madison of Virginia was 17 years her senior, and Episcopalian in background, they were married in September 1794. The marriage, though childless, was notably happy; \"our hearts understand each other,\" she assured him. He could even be patient with Dolley's son, Payne, who mishandled his own affairs--and, eventually, mismanaged Madison's estate.\r\n\r\nDiscarding the somber Quaker dress after her second marriage, Dolley chose the finest of fashions. Margaret Bayard Smith, chronicler of early Washington social life, wrote: \"She looked a Queen...It would be absolutely impossible for any one to behave with more perfect propriety than she did.\"\r\n\r\nBlessed with a desire to please and a willingness to be pleased, Dolley made her home the center of society when Madison began, in 1801, his eight years as Jefferson's Secretary of State. She assisted at the White House when the President asked her help in receiving ladies, and presided at the first inaugural ball in Washington when her husband became Chief Executive in 1809.\r\n\r\nDolley's social graces made her famous. Her political acumen, prized by her husband, is less renowned, though her gracious tact smoothed many a quarrel. Hostile statesmen, difficult envoys from Spain or Tunisia, warrior chiefs from the west, flustered youngsters--she always welcomed everyone. Forced to flee from the White House by a British army during the War of 1812, she returned to find the mansion in ruins. Undaunted by temporary quarters, she entertained as skillfully as ever.\r\n\r\nAt their plantation Montpelier in Virginia, the Madisons lived in pleasant retirement until he died in 1836. She returned to the capital in the autumn of 1837, and friends found tactful ways to supplement her diminished income. She remained in Washington until her death in 1849, honored and loved by all. The delightful personality of this unusual woman is a cherished part of her country's history.\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/history\/firstladies\/dm4.html",

"Biography":"Green, John Cleve (1800-1875) was the College's greatest benefactor during the presidency of James McCosh. By the time McCosh retired in 1888, Green and his residuary legatees had contributed ``to the good of the College,'' President McCosh said in his farewell report, ``upwards of a million and a half, perhaps two million dollars.'' \r\n\r\nGreen was born in Lawrenceville, New Jersey, and was a member of the first class to enter what became the Lawrenceville School. He did not go to college, but entered the employ of New York merchants with extensive foreign trade. He spent ten years as supercargo of ships visiting South America and China, and by the time he was forty had acquired an ample fortune in the China trade, derived from the tea and textile business and, after the end of the East India Company's monopoly, from the opium trade. This fortune he enhanced by investments in railroads, whose dividends often reached 15 percent. His three children having died young, he made substantial gifts to various philanthropies. He was a principal benefactor of the Deaf and Dumb Asylum and the Home for Ruptured and Crippled in New York City, and of the Lawrenceville School and the Princeton Theological Seminary, as well as of Princeton College. \r\n\r\nGreen secured for the College in 1866 the land that now forms the northeast corner of the main Campus. In 1870 he gave the College its first recitation building, named for his great-great-grandfather, John Dickinson, first president of the College. In 1873 he gave the College its first library building, named for his brother, Henry Woodhull Green 1820, Chancellor of New Jersey and a trustee, and the same year he also donated funds for a school of science, which was named for him. \r\n\r\nHe endowed the Joseph Henry professorship, and his legatees provided further funds for science and for civil engineering as well as for professorships in Latin and Greek. The benefactions from his estate continued into the 1890s and included the erection of the College's first chemical laboratory building at the corner of Nassau Street and Washington Road in 1891. \r\n\r\nAfter the John C. Green School of Science burned down in 1928, the Engineering Building that had just been completed on Washington Road was named for Green; in 1962 when the School of Engineering moved into the new Engineering Quadrangle, its old building was assigned to other departments and called Green Hall. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Alexander Leitch, A Princeton Companion, copyright Princeton University Press (1978). \r\n",

"Biography":"Sarah Pierpont was born in 1710 in New Haven, Connecticut, to a distinguished family of educated preachers. At age thirteen, she attracted the attention of Jonathan Edwards, who described her extraordinary piety in his essay \"On Sarah Pierrpont.\" They were married four years later, shortly after Jonathan Edwards was ordained a minister in Northampton, Massachusetts. Her husband used her as an example in his sermons, as he often identified spirituality with beauty. During the 1730s Jonathan Edwards was at the center of the Christian revitalizaiton movement in New England known as the Greak Awakening. The excessive fervor of the movement was later rejected and in the late 1740s Jonathan Edwards moved to Stockbridge, Massachusetts, where the family lived there for seven years. In 1758 they moved to Princeton, New Jersey, when Jonathan Edwards was offered the presidency of the College of New Jersey. He died several weeks after taking the post, and seven months later Sarah herself died of rheumatic fever.",

"Biography":"Established soon after the ascent of communism in the Soviet Union, The Newcomen Society in North America championed American capitalism, material civilization and entrepreneurship. But the English and American branches together counted only 323 members in 1933, the year leadership for The Newcomen Society in North America went to its co-founder and Loree's friend, Charles Penrose, Sr. (1886-1958). A graduate of Princeton University who once intended to become a minister but instead chose a career in engineering, Penrose found a new calling at Newcomen. Declining a salary, he became senior vice-president when the presidency was largely honorary, and under his dynamic governance the society achieved stature and prestige. He started sectional committees and aggressively recruited as members industrialists, educators, bankers and businessmen. Membership soared to 12,000, while the British chapter numbered less than 500.\r\n\r\nIn the late 1940s, Penrose built the society's headquarters on Newcomen Road in rural Exton, Pennsylvania, complete with a 2,700 volume library and museum featuring a range of model steam engines operated by hand-cranking or electricity. Beside a chapel stood a belltower which played a carillon. Designed by the Philadelphia architect Briton Martin (1899-1983), the campus had offices, guest houses and a printing shop for Newcomen Publications, Inc., which Penrose founded to produce the society's distinctive illustrated booklets featuring company histories. At Seapoint Beach in Kittery Point, Maine, the society maintained a summer retreat with guest cottages.\r\n\r\nPenrose appeared to know personally the top executives of every major company in the United States, and by charisma and will, made Newcomen an important part of their lives. Called a \"benevolent despot,\" he oversaw every detail on the society's production line of tributes to organizations, from editing and publishing an average of 55 booklet histories per year, to officiating across the country at 60-70 luncheons and dinners annually at which the histories were orated by their authors. Except for educators, expenses were usually paid by the enterprises being honored, which bought for distribution over 12,000 copies to enhance their reputations. It is no exaggeration to say that, in its heyday, anyone who was anyone in American commerce, manufacturing and academia belonged to The Newcomen Society in North America. In 1952, Time Magazine referred to Penrose as \"a combination of P. T. Barnum and the Archbishop of Canterbury.\" It quoted him saying:\r\n\r\n\"We are attempting to hold up to America the vision and the courage and the hard work and abiding faith -- make that a capital F -- of the men who years ago created the America which we have inherited.\" \r\nCharles Penrose, Sr. died suddenly in 1958, the year he finally became president\r\n",

"Biography":"In the thick of party conflict in 1800, Thomas Jefferson wrote in a private letter, \"I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.\" \r\n\r\nThis powerful advocate of liberty was born in 1743 in Albemarle County, Virginia, inheriting from his father, a planter and surveyor, some 5,000 acres of land, and from his mother, a Randolph, high social standing. He studied at the College of William and Mary, then read law. In 1772 he married Martha Wayles Skelton, a widow, and took her to live in his partly constructed mountaintop home, Monticello. \r\n\r\nFreckled and sandy-haired, rather tall and awkward, Jefferson was eloquent as a correspondent, but he was no public speaker. In the Virginia House of Burgesses and the Continental Congress, he contributed his pen rather than his voice to the patriot cause. As the \"silent member\" of the Congress, Jefferson, at 33, drafted the Declaration of Independence. In years following he labored to make its words a reality in Virginia. Most notably, he wrote a bill establishing religious freedom, enacted in 1786. \r\n\r\nJefferson succeeded Benjamin Franklin as minister to France in 1785. His sympathy for the French Revolution led him into conflict with Alexander Hamilton when Jefferson was Secretary of State in President Washington's Cabinet. He resigned in 1793. \r\n\r\nSharp political conflict developed, and two separate parties, the Federalists and the Democratic-Republicans, began to form. Jefferson gradually assumed leadership of the Republicans, who sympathized with the revolutionary cause in France. Attacking Federalist policies, he opposed a strong centralized Government and championed the rights of states. \r\n\r\nAs a reluctant candidate for President in 1796, Jefferson came within three votes of election. Through a flaw in the Constitution, he became Vice President, although an opponent of President Adams. In 1800 the defect caused a more serious problem. Republican electors, attempting to name both a President and a Vice President from their own party, cast a tie vote between Jefferson and Aaron Burr. The House of Representatives settled the tie. Hamilton, disliking both Jefferson and Burr, nevertheless urged Jefferson's election. \r\n\r\nWhen Jefferson assumed the Presidency, the crisis in France had passed. He slashed Army and Navy expenditures, cut the budget, eliminated the tax on whiskey so unpopular in the West, yet reduced the national debt by a third. He also sent a naval squadron to fight the Barbary pirates, who were harassing American commerce in the Mediterranean. Further, although the Constitution made no provision for the acquisition of new land, Jefferson suppressed his qualms over constitutionality when he had the opportunity to acquire the Louisiana Territory from Napoleon in 1803. \r\n\r\nDuring Jefferson's second term, he was increasingly preoccupied with keeping the Nation from involvement in the Napoleonic wars, though both England and France interfered with the neutral rights of American merchantmen. Jefferson's attempted solution, an embargo upon American shipping, worked badly and was unpopular. \r\n\r\nJefferson retired to Monticello to ponder such projects as his grand designs for the University of Virginia. A French nobleman observed that he had placed his house and his mind \"on an elevated situation, from which he might contemplate the universe.\" \r\n\r\nHe died on July 4, 1826. \r\nhttp:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/history\/presidents\/tj3.html",

"Biography":"L. B. Stillwell, who worked from 1886-1900 for the famous electrical engineering firm of Westinghouse (which had been commissioned to illuminate the magical 1893 Columbian World's Exposition, an explosive architectural event that gave birth to the American Renaissance) and who had helped to electrify Niagara Falls, was hired by the Hudson & Manhattan Railroad Company in 1905.\r\n\r\nStillwell's private firm consisted of an extraordinary staff of electrical and mechanical wunderkinds, all young, eager, visionary. John Van Vleck, the firm's most brilliant employee who had designed the IRT's sub-stations in Manhattan, was given the responsibility of designing the structural steelwork of the H&M RR Powerhouse. Hugh Hazelton, a resident of nearby Englewood, New Jersey, became the designer of all sophisticated, revolutionary, and expensive electrical machinery within the Powerhouse. Stillwell, a rival of Thomas Edison, himself designed the company's trolley cars.\r\n\r\nStillwell's obituary in the New York Times detailed his engineering accomplishments:\r\n\r\nLewis Buckley Stillwell, a resident of Princeton and a life trustee of Princeton University, who was one of the leading American electrical engineers, died today in the Union Memorial Hospital in Baltimore at the age of 77 after a week's illness.\r\n\r\nBorn in Scranton, Pa., Mr. Stillwell received his degree of electrical engineer from Lehigh in 1885. The next year he joined the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company as an assistant electrician. From 1891 to 1897 he was the company's chief electrical engineer, and during this period he performed services of great importance in the development of the alternating current and had an influential role in determining the Westinghouse policy in respect to system development engineering and the establishment of 60 and 30 cycles as standard frequencies.\r\n\r\nMr. Stillwell's contributions, as Westinghouse engineer, to the general layout and design of the first plant of the Niagara Falls Power Company, led to his appointment as electrical director of that company, a post he held from 1897 to 1900. Since the latter date he had been a consultant, with headquarters in New York.\r\n\r\nUntil his retirement in 1938, Mr. Stillwell was engaged on a succession of electrical engineering undertakings of the first magnitude. He was consulting expert to the Manhattan Elevated Railway Company on the electrification of the elevated lines of New York City, 1900-1906; to the Rapid Transit Subway Construction Company, 1900-1909; the Hudson & Manhattan Railroad, 1905-1913; to the Erie Railroad for its electrification work, in 1906; United Railways and Electric Company of Baltimore, 1906-1920; Interborough Rapid Transit Company of New York, 1909-1920; for the electrification of the Hoosac Tunnel of the Boston & Maine Railroad, 1900-11; New York Municipal Railway Corporation, 1913-1916; to the New York and New Jersey Commissions in connection with the Holland Tunnel, 1924-1927; and to the Port of New York Authority, 1927-1938.\r\n\r\nA former president of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, Mr. Stillwell had received from it the Lamme Medal, 1933, \"for his distinguished career in connection with the design, installation and operation of electrical machinery and equipment,\" and the Edison Medal, 1936, \"for his pioneer work in the generation, distribution and utilization of electric energy.\"\r\n\r\nThe Engineering Foundation, the research organization of the national engineering societies, elected Mr. Stillwell its chairman for four successive terms ending in 1929, and in that year the American Society of Civil Engineers conferred on him a medal \"for leadership in consolidating the research work of the Foundation and the Founder Societies.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Stillwell was president of the American Institute of Consulting Engineers, 1918-1919; a member of the board of directors of the Chamber of Commerce of the United States, 1921-1923; and a member of many other professional and civic groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHistorical Sources\r\nGray, Christopher. \"Streetscapes: The Hudson Tubes Powerhouse: A Majestic, Aging Giant.\" The New York Times: November 18, 1990. \r\nThe New York Times: \"Hugh Hazelton, Retired Engineer, Ex-Englewood Official, Stricken In Florida,\" January 29, 1940; \"Lewis B.

"Biography":"Hobart Amory Hare Baker (January 15, 1892 – December 21, 1918), known as Hobey Baker, was a noted American amateur athlete of the early 20th century. The only member of both the College Football Hall of Fame and Hockey Hall of Fame, U.S. college hockey's annual award for most outstanding player is named in his honor.\r\n\r\nContents [hide]\r\n1 Life \r\n2 In Literature \r\n3 Legacy \r\n4 Biography \r\n5 See also \r\n6 External links \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n[edit] Life\r\nBaker was born in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Philadelphia. He attended St. Paul's School, Concord, New Hampshire, where Malcolm Gordon was coach of the ice hockey team, graduating in 1909.\r\n\r\nIn 1910 he enrolled in Princeton University. During his time there, he was elected to the Ivy Club, while also playing baseball, football and hockey. Because Princeton's athletic rules limited athletes to participation in only two varsity sports, Baker gave up baseball after his freshman year, concentrating solely on football and hockey. By the time he graduated, he had led Princeton to a national championship in football (1911) and two national championships in hockey (1912 and 1914). Baker was also famous for his refusal to wear headgear in football and for the fact that he was penalized only once during his entire hockey career at Princeton.\r\n\r\nFollowing graduation, he worked at J. P. Morgan Bank in New York City and played for the St. Nicholas Club in Manhattan, one of the top amateur clubs in the United States (there was no professional American hockey at that time). He enlisted in the U.S. Army as a pilot upon the country's entry into World War I and left for Europe in 1917. By 1918, he was a member of the United States Army Air Service, commanding the 103rd Aero Squadron, whose members consisted mainly of veterans of the Lafayette Escadrille. He painted his Spad XIII orange and black in honor of his alma mater.\r\n\r\nContrary to the newspaper accounts of his day, however, Baker was not an ace. He had only three confirmed kills to his name, rather than the necessary five, although he was awarded the Croix de Guerre by the French government for his service. He was killed in a plane crash just weeks after the armistice ending the war while test flying one of his squadron's newly repaired Spads near Toul. Ironically, his orders to return home to the United States were found tucked inside his jacket. He is buried in West Laurel Hill Cemetery, Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n\r\n[edit] In Literature\r\nF. Scott Fitzgerald, who was several years behind Baker at Princeton (Baker was class of 1914, Fitzgerald the class of 1917), memorialized him twice in the novel \"This Side of Paradise\". The protagonist is named Amory Blaine, in reference to Baker's full name. Another character in the novel, Allenby, is based on Fitzgerald's impressions of Baker as an undergraduate.\r\n\r\nMark Goodman's 1985 novel, \"Hurrah! For the Next Man Who Dies\" is a fictionalized account of Baker's time at Princeton and in World War I, as told by one of his friends and classmates.\r\n\r\n\r\n[edit] Legacy\r\nBaker is not only considered one of the greatest ice hockey players of his era, but is also regarded as the first great American hockey player. In 1945 he was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, one of only a handful of Americans to be so honored, and was inducted into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame as one of its charter members in 1973. In 1975, he was also inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame.\r\n\r\nToday, the Hobey Baker Memorial Award is given annually to the top male U.S. college hockey player, and Princeton's Hobey Baker Memorial Rink is also named in his honor. At St. Paul's, hockey players still compete for an award known simply as \"Hobey's Stick.\"\r\n\r\n",

"Biography":"Nathan Hale was a young man who had every prospect for a happy and fulfilling life. Contemporary accounts indicate that he was kind, gentle, religious, athletic, intelligent, good looking and as one acquaintance testified, “the idol of all his acquaintances.” Both men and women commented on his striking appearance. He had fair skin and hair, light blue eyes, and stood just under six feet tall. No wonder it was said that all the girls in New Haven were in love with him. While many were impressed by his kindness and strong Christian ideals, he was also known for his skill in wrestling, football, and broad jumping.\r\n\r\nYet in spite of the above, this remarkable young man ended his life in the most ignominious manner known to his era: death by hanging – the ultimate degradation – reserved only for the most despicable of criminals. He risked this fate willingly to serve a cause as yet unproven or established, a cause more likely to be soon annihilated. Nathan Hale is representative of many young eighteenth century professionals who were obsessed with being of service for the public good, who – foreshadowing a twentieth century brand of patriotism – asked not what their country could do for them but rather what they could do for their country.\r\n\r\nNathan Hale of Coventry, Connecticut was born in 1755 into two respectable New England families. His parents, Richard Hale and Elizabeth Strong Hale, were staunch Puritans who believed in religious devotion, work ethic, and education. The sixth of ten surviving siblings, he was tutored by the local minister, Rev. Dr. Joseph Huntington, who greatly influenced his love of learning. In 1769, both Nathan and his brother, Enoch, were sent to Yale College at the ages of 14 and 16, respectively. They became part of the shining Class of 1773, many of whom were destined to have remarkable careers in the service of their country, their state, and their communities.\r\n\r\nDuring his college years, Nathan was exposed to the cosmopolitan atmosphere of New Haven and to many new, progressive ideas of the eighteenth century. It was doubtless a different world from the isolated farming community where he had been raised. Both brothers belonged to the literary fraternity, Linonia, which debated educational topics and issues of the day – including astronomy, mathematics, literature, and the ethics of slavery. Meetings were held in the students’ rooms at New College – a large brick dormitory in the center of campus. This beautiful building, where Nathan and Enoch were roommates, still stands on the Yale campus (Connecticut Hall). His time was full of activity, strong friendships, and varied interests, including helping to establish Yale’s first secular library. Nathan graduated from Yale with first honors at the age of eighteen, participating in the 1773 commencement debate: Whether the education of daughters be not without any just reason, more neglected than that of sons.\r\n\r\nLike many young graduates, Hale took a position teaching school – first in East Haddam and later in New London, Connecticut. In rural East Haddam, however, Hale appears to have been lonely, missing the lively company of his college friends. New London was definitely more to his liking – it even had a newspaper, liberal in character, published by Timothy Green, a proprietor of the Union School. His classes consisted of about thirty young men who were taught Latin, writing, mathematics, and the classics. In 1774, he also conducted a summer school for young ladies from 5 to 7 AM. That the young ladies of New London were willing to attend a 5 AM class in the classics was perhaps more a tribute to the schoolmaster’s good looks than any attraction to the subject at hand. Although he never appears to have been serious about marriage, during 1774 he was teased by two former classmates about an infatuation with his landlord’s niece, Elizabeth Adams. Although Elizabeth married in 1775, in 1837 she wrote a stunningly beautiful remembrance of her friend, Nathan Hale, then dead for sixty-one years.\r\n\r\nNathan enjoyed teaching and his mild manner of imparting knowledge was greatly appreciated by both students and parents alike. Consequently, in late 1774 he was offered a permanent teaching position as the master of the Union School and it appears that he intended to make teaching his profession. During this same year, he also joined a local militia and was elected first sergeant. While his amiability made him many delightful acquaintances among the town’s best families, nineteen-year old Nathan Hale also continued several close friendships with his former Yale classmates. Their surviving letters tell of the joys, frustrations, romances, and boredom experienced by young people on the threshold of life and painfully impatient for it all to unfold. By the spring of 1775 therefore, civic-minded Nathan Hale had many interesting friends, a great job that he enjoyed, perhaps a girl friend (or more), and an enjoyable life in a bustling cosmopolitan seaport city. Everything was going his way.\r\n\r\nWhen war broke out in April, many chapters of Connecticut militia rushed to Massachusetts to help their neighbors during the Siege of Boston. Hale’s militia marched immediately but he remained behind – perhaps because of his current teaching contract which did not expire until July, 1775. Or perhaps he was unsure. Contemporary letters tell of the conflict that went on in his friends’ minds – doubtless mirrored in his own – whether to join the new army and fight in Boston or to keep quiet and wait. This was not the clear decision we all see today and these young professionals had a lot to lose. The new master of a prestigious private school does not without considerable risk take on the label of rebel and traitor.\r\n\r\nIn July 1775, Nathan received a heartfelt letter from classmate and friend, Benjamin Tallmadge. Always the pragmatist, Tallmadge had gone to see the Siege of Boston for himself. Upon his return, Ben poured out his heart in a letter to Nathan dated July 4, 1775 – the last year that date would be just another day. After analyzing the pros and cons of joining up, Tallmadge finally told Nathan that, in spite of his friend’s engagement in a noble public service (teaching school), “Was I in your condition ... I think the more extensive Service would be my choice. Our holy Religion, the honour of our God, a glorious country, & a happy constitution is what we have to defend.” The day after receiving Tallmadge’s letter, Nathan Hale accepted a commission as first lieutenant in the 7th Connecticut Regiment under Colonel Charles Webb of Stamford.\r\n\r\nStationed at Winter Hill, Hale enjoyed military life and threw himself wholeheartedly into the duties of a company commander, trying to be a good officer, yet yielding to and clearly enjoying the new, macho experiences of camp life. Like most young soldiers, he complained about his superiors and worried about his subordinates – on one occasion offering his own salary to his men if they would stay in the army another month. Still – he told his friends – he was enthusiastic, happy to be there, and wouldn’t accept leave even if he could get one.\r\n\r\nWhen Washington reorganized the army, Nathan received a captain’s commission in the new 19th Connecticut Regiment and – to his credit – several men asked to be placed under his command. In the spring of 1776, the army moved to Manhattan to prevent the British from taking New York City. Nathan spent six months at Bayard’s Mount building fortifications and preparing for the inevitable battle. When the British invaded Long Island in August, 1776, Hale had still not seen combat and his regiment also missed fighting in the Battle of Long Island. After almost a year in the army, he had kept records, drawn supplies, written receipts, and supervised guard duty. These were not the daring exploits young men dreamed of when they went to war.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of September 1776, with the British in command of Western Long Island and the rebel army trying to defend Manhattan, Washington formed The New England Rangers, an elite, green beret-type unit under Lt. Col. Thomas Knowlton. Hale was invited to command one the four companies assigned to forward reconnaissance around the Westchester and Manhattan shorelines. Meanwhile, Washington desperately needed to know the site of the upcoming British invasion of Manhattan Island. The best way to obtain this pivotal information was to send a spy behind enemy lines but in honor-conscious eighteenth century minds, spying was considered to be a demeaning, dishonest, and indecent activity – unworthy of a gentleman.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Knowlton persuaded Nathan Hale to volunteer for this spy duty behind enemy lines. Before leaving, Nathan asked his fellow officer and friend, Captain William Hull, for advice. Hull tried hard to dissuade him from the dangerous and controversial mission but in the end Nathan justified it by saying that any task necessary for the public good became honorable by being necessary. This was finally his chance to do something valuable to the patriot cause.\r\n\r\nAccompanied by his sergeant, Steven Hempstead, Hale left Harlem Village in early September and headed north along the East River. Although armed with an order allowing him to commandeer any armed American vessel, Hale was prevented from crossing to Long Island by numerous British ships on patrol. He finally found passage at Norwalk, Connecticut and crossed the Long Island Sound in a rebel longboat. Leaving his uniform, commission, silver shoe buckles and other personal possessions with Hempstead, Nathan Hale slipped into the darkness at Huntington Bay, Long Island and dropped out of sight – both to his friends and to history.\r\n\r\nHe doubtless spent several days behind enemy lines in his contrived disguise as an schoolmaster looking for work. Before he could return with any useful information, however, the British invaded Manhattan at Kip’s Bay (East River at 34th Street), taking most of the island on September 15th and 16th. His mission negated, Hale may have crossed into British-occupied New York City presumably to gain whatever intelligence he could for Washington, who was now entrenched behind the bluffs at Harlem Heights. On September 20th, New York City was set on fire, causing confusion, rioting, and a heightened alert for rebel sympathizers. By this time, Hale is thought to have returned to Long Island for a planned rendezvous with the longboat. On the evening of September 21, 1776, he was somehow stopped, perhaps near Flushing Bay, Long Island, by the Queen’s Rangers, a new company of Loyalists led by Lt. Col. Robert Rogers (of Northwest Passage fame).\r\n\r\nThe circumstances of his capture have never come to light although many theories have been proposed. Almost immediately after Hale’s death, rumors flew that he had actually been recognized while undercover by his first cousin, Samuel Hale, a dedicated Loyalist then working for the British in New York. Samuel denied these allegations and what part, if any, he had in his cousin’s fate has never been substantiated.\r\n\r\nNathan Hale was immediately brought for questioning before the British commander, General William Howe, who had just moved into the Beekman Mansion (51st Street and 1st Avenue). Intelligence information was found on his person and since this was not in code or invisible ink, he was irrevocably compromised. Hale identified himself, his rank, and the purpose of his mission, perhaps to regain a semblance of an honest soldier (rather than a spy). Although Howe was moved by the young man’s demeanor and patriotism, he was out of uniform behind enemy lines. The customs of war were clear and Nathan was sentenced to hang the next day.\r\n\r\nA tradition says that Hale spent the night confined in a greenhouse on the Beekman estate and that he was denied a minister or even a bible by the provost marshal, an unsavory character named William Cunningham. The next morning, Sunday, September 22, 1776 at 11:00 AM, Nathan Hale was marched north, about a mile up the Post Road to the Park of Artillery. It was located next to a public house called the Dove Tavern (66th Street and 3rd Avenue), about 5 1\/2 miles from the city limits. After making a “sensible and spirited speech” to those few in attendance, the former schoolteacher and Yale graduate was executed by hanging – an extremely ignominious and horrible fate to one of his time and class.\r\n\r\nWhether Hale said that he only regretted having one life to lose for his country has been debated. The quote comes from a British engineer, John Montresor, who kindly sheltered Nathan in his marquee while they were making preparations for the hanging. Hale entered and appeared calm, asking Montresor for writing materials. He then wrote two letters – one to his favorite brother and classmate, Enoch Hale, and the other to his military commander (these letters have never been found and were probably destroyed by the provost marshal).\r\n\r\nCaptain Montresor witnessed the hanging and was touched by the event, the patriot’s composure, and his last words. As fate would have it, Montresor was ordered to deliver a message from General Howe to Washington (under a white flag) that very afternoon. While at American headquarters, he told Alexander Hamilton, then a captain of artillery, about Hale’s fate. Captain Hull found out and went with the delegation returning Washington’s answer to Howe whereupon he managed to speak with Montresor. The British engineer told Hull that Nathan had impressed everyone with his sense of gentle dignity and his consciousness of rectitude and high intentions. Montresor quoted Nathan’s words on the gallows as: “I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my country.”\r\n\r\nThis elegant statement, doubtless paraphrased from Addison’s popular play, Cato, is the quotation best remembered from the execution of Nathan Hale. He must have been telling the British that his cause still had great merit and that someone like himself – intelligent, educated, and decent – was willing to die for it without regret. It should be put in prospective that the cause was in bad shape in September 1776. The much-defeated and demoralized rebel army had been chased into upper Manhattan, ripe for total destruction by the vastly superior British forces. Its soldiers were deserting in droves now – sometimes whole companies at once – and the end seemed only a matter of time. But Hale told the British straight – standing on the gallows – that his country was still worthwhile and worth dying for.\r\n\r\nWilliam Hull later told the world about his friend’s patriotism, bravery, and sacrifice; however, since Hull’s account is not that of an eyewitness, many historians have denied his story as a unsubstantiated folk legend. If this is true, it means that either Montresor or Hull lied about Hale’s last words, which seems like a strange thing for either of them to do. From a practical standpoint, it is hard to believe that Hale would have been so well remembered had he not distinguished himself in some outstanding manner at his execution. He was a junior officer of no significance and even his brief spy mission had failed.\r\n\r\nAnother credible statement purporting to be from Nathan Hale’s execution is found in the diary of Lt. Robert MacKensie, a British officer in New York at the time. The diary entry was made on the very day of Hale’s execution, September 22, 1776: “He behaved with great composure and resolution, saying he thought it the duty of every good Officer, to obey any orders given him by his Commander-in-Chief; and desired the Spectators to be at all times prepared to meet death in whatever shape it might appear.” This indicates that Hale wanted to be remembered as a soldier under orders and not a spy.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, an insignificant schoolteacher who never wrote anything important, never owned any property, never had a permanent job, never married or had children, never fought in a battle and who failed in his final mission – made history in the last few seconds of this life. He is to be admired because of his courage in accepting a difficult mission (both dishonorable and dangerous) that he did not have to do. Then he had the cool and presence of mind to set the British straight about American patriotism, literally in the shadow of the gallows. We don’t know what exactly he said, but it must have been impressive and Hale deserves to be remembered for his genuine dedication, his courage, and his willingness to pay the price with honor and dignity.\r\n\r\nNathan Hale’s body was left hanging for several days near the site of his execution and later was buried in an unmarked grave. He was 21 years old.\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2001 by Mary J. Ortner, Ph.D.\r\nAll rights reserved\r\n\r\n",

"Biography":"Died in ship collision on Ville du Havre with his sister Martha in 1873. He was an excellent swimmer, however, his sister did not swim and it was reported that he remained with her rather than swimming to safety. They both drowned. Hamilton and Martha were sailing to recover from the deaths of both parents in one year when their ship was struck mid ship by the sailing ship \"Loch Earn\".\r\n\r\nAt 16 he was sent to Europe to complete college preparation. After two years @ University of Pennsylvania he transferred to Princeton where he graduated in 1872. His will, which was written the night before he embarked on his fatal voyage, left $20,000 to the Philadelphian Society of Princeton for the erection of an assembly hall and library to be used \"for religious purposes only.\" The society, an offshoot of the Young Men's Christian Association, had been formed by a group of Princeton undergraduates in 1825 to promote religious activities both on and off campus. Murray Hall was completed in 1879 on the Princeton University campus. It was later known as Murray\/Dodge Hall and still later Theatre Intime.\r\n\r\nIn the eulogy delivered by Rev. J. Winthrop Hagerman, Hamilton was widely respected for his \"absolute fidelity to every trust, whether love or of obligation.\"\r\n\r\nReference: \"Princeton Alumni Weekly\" 9 Oct. 1978 from the article \"The Ghost of Murray Hall\"\r\n\r\nMore About Hamilton Murray: Degree: 1872, Princeton University. \r\n\r\n",

"Biography":"The American soldier, diplomat, and politician John Armstrong was born at Carlisle, Pennsylvania, on the 25th of November 1758. His father, also named John Armstrong (1725-1795), a native of the north of Ireland, who had emigrated to the Pennsylvania frontier between 1745 and 1748, served successively as a brigadier-general in the Continental Army (1776-7), as brigadier-general and then major-general of the Pennsylvania militia (1777-83), during the War of Independce, and was a member of the Continental Congress in 1779-80 and again in 1787-88. The son studied for a time at the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University), and served as a major in the War of Independence. In March 1783, while the Continental Army was stationed at Newburgh, New York, he wrote and issued, anonymously, the famous \"Newburgh Adresses.\" In 1784 he led a force of Pennsylvania militia against the Connecticut settlers in Wyoming Valley, and treated them in such a high-handed manner as to incur the disapproval even of the Pennsylvania legislature. In 1789 he married the daughter of Chancellor Robert R. Livingston of New York, and removed to New York city, where his own ability and his family connection gave him great political influence. In 1801-2 and again in 1803-4 he was a member of the United States Senate. From 1804 to 1810 he was the United States Ambassador to France, and in March 1806 he was joined with James Bowdoin as a special minister to treat through France with Spain concerning the acquisition of Florida, Spanish spoliations of American commerce, and the \"Louisiana\" boundary. During the War of 1812, he was a brigadier-general in the United States Army from July 1812 until January 1813, and from then until August 1814 Secretary of War in the cabinet of President James Madison, when his unpopularity forced him to resign. \"In spite of Armstrong's services, abilities, and experience\", says Henry Adams, \"something in his character always created distrust. He had every vantage of education, social and political connection, ability and self-confidence... but he suffered from the reputation of indolence and intrigue.\" Nevertheless, he \"introduced into the army an energy wholly new\", an energy the results of which were apparent \"for half a century.\" After his resignation he lived in retirement at Red Hook, New York, where he died on the 1st of April 1843. He published Notices of the War of 1812 (2 vols., 1836; new ed., 1840), the value of which is greatly impaired by its obvious partiality. \r\n\r\nFather: John Armstrong (politician and soldier, b. 1725, d. 1795)\r\nWife: (sister of Robert R.

His ancestors were among the early Dutch settlers of the neighborhood, and so common was the name Cornelius among them that those who bore it were obliged to adopt distinguishing initials to prevent mistakes. This accounted for the middle \"C.\" of Dr. Cuyler's name. In 1806 he was graduated at Union, and began to study theology under Drs. Livingstone and Bassett. In 1809 he was ordained pastor of the Reformed Dutch Church in Poughkeepsie, New York, where he remained for twenty-five years, strengthening and uniting a congregation that he found in a weak and almost divided condition. As a preacher he was exceptionally successful, and several revivals occurred under his ministry. An invitation from the 2d Presbyterian Church of Philadelphia was accepted in 1834, and the pastoral relation then assumed continued during the remainder of his life. For many years he was president of the board of trustees of Jefferson medical College. In 1838 he received the degree of S. T. D. from Union. Besides a large number of sermons, published separately, he was the author of \"A Narrative of a Revival of Religion in the Reformed Dutch Church, Poughkeepsie, 1815,\" and three tracts issued by the Presbyterian board of publication. Their titles are \"The Parity of the Ministry,\" \"Evidences of a Gracious State,\" and \" Who shall dwell in Heaven?\" He also wrote for the religious press, notably a series of essays on the Atonement, published in the \"Journal and Telegraph,\" of Albany.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEdited Appletons Encyclopedia, Copyright © 2001 VirtualologyTM",

"Biography":"Roger Sessions (1896-1985) is one of the musical giants of the 20th century, a composer of profound emotion, uncompromising honesty, and consummate craftsmanship. His works have been performed by most of the world’s major musical organizations, and have earned him universal admiration and respect. In addition, he has made important contributions to American music as an educator, counting among his former pupils such eminent composers as Ellen Taaffe Zwilich, George Tsontakis, Milton Babbitt, Andrew Imbrie, Leon Kirchner, David Diamond, and Hugo Weisgall.\r\n\r\nBorn in Brooklyn in 1896, Sessions showed remarkable intellectual and musical precocity, entering Harvard at the age of 14. He later attended Yale, studying with Horatio Parker after a plan to study with Ravel was prevented by the War. He was most strongly influenced in his early years by Ernest Bloch, first as his student and later as his assistant at the Cleveland Institute of Music. He later was able to go to Europe, and lived and worked in Paris, Berlin and Florence during the years 1925 to 1933.\r\n\r\nHis first big success was the 1928 The Black Maskers: Suite. His style subsequently evolved through the open intervals of the Symphony No. 1 to the more chromatic Violin Concerto of 1935. Later works in the 1950s used the 12-note technique, as exemplified by works such as the Symphony No. 3.\r\n\r\nSessions was associated with a number of institutions, including the University of California, Princeton University, and the Juilliard School of Music. His honors include several Guggenheim Fellowships, a Carnegie Fellowship, a Prix de Rome, an honorary doctorate from Harvard, and membership in the National Institute of Arts and Letters and the International Society for Contemporary Music, among many others. In addition to a special Pulitzer citation bestowed for his life’s work in 1974, Mr. Sessions was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for his Concerto for Orchestra in 1982, which also turned out to be his final work\r\n",

"Biography":"Donald Ross Hamilton, a nuclear physicist, was a member of the Princeton faculty for twenty-five years. He graduated with highest honors in physics from Princeton in 1935 and earned his doctorate from Columbia University in 1939. From 1942 to 1946, he was associated with high-priority World War II research projects at M.I.T.'s Radiation Laboratory and with the Sperry Gyroscope Company. Joining Princeton in 1946 as an assitant professor, he advanced to an associate professorship in 1948 and to the rank of full professor in 1955. His research activities at Princeton in nuclear physics included the theory and observation of beta decay and of angular correlations of successive nuclear radiations. In later years, he was largely concerned with atomic-beam investigations of the spins and moments of radioactive nuclei. Dr. Hamitlon headed the University's Graduate School from 1958 to 1965.\r\n",

"Biography":"Pittendrigh was dean of graduate studies at Princeton when he agreed to come to Stanford in 1969. He was one of a group of senior faculty who founded the Human Biology undergraduate major in 1970, and was named the first Bing Professor in Human Biology. \r\n\r\n\"Colin Pittendrigh was one of Stanford's truly great teachers,\" said Donald Kennedy, president emeritus of Stanford and another Hum Bio program founder. Kennedy was chair of biological sciences when he helped recruit Pittendrigh to move west. \r\n\r\n\"Colin taught, famously, the introductory course [titled 'The Evolution of Life and the Emergence of Man'] that freshmen took to prepare for the core curriculum. It was in every respect a great course. It became a legend,\" Kennedy said. \r\n\r\n\"He had already had a wonderful career at Princeton, but he had a whole second career here. He was a model for everyone because he cared about teaching, particularly the teaching of undergraduates, at the same time he was doing marvelous science.\" \r\n\r\nDuring his service as director of Hopkins Marine Station in 1976-84, Pittendrigh is credited with helping to re-build Stanford's century-old marine laboratory. New faculty and facilities brought modern molecular biology, ecology and biomechanics to marine biology at Hopkins, according to biological sciences Professor David Epel. \r\n\r\n\"The station is now internationally famous, very healthy, very vigorous, and Colin started that, getting it back on its track,\" Epel said. \r\n\r\nPittendrigh was born Oct. 13, 1918, in Whitely Bay, England. He received his B.Sc. degree in 1940 from the University of Durham in England. He was assigned to wartime service as a biologist, and worked for the Rockefeller Foundation and the government of Trinidad to control malaria-bearing mosquitoes near military bases there. After the war he served as an adviser on malaria to the Brazilian government. \r\n\r\nHe was a University Fellow at Columbia University in 1945-46 and received his doctorate from Columbia in 1948, after joining the faculty at Princeton in 1947 as an assistant professor of biology. He became a U.S. citizen in 1950. \r\n\r\nAt Princeton, Pittendrigh held the chair of Class of 1877 Professor of Zoology. He served as dean of graduate studies from 1965 to 1969. He also served on a variety of national scientific boards including the science advisory committee to the administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. He was chair of the 1964 National Academy of Sciences study, \"Biology and the Exploration of Mars.\" \r\n\r\nAmong his numerous honors were a Guggenheim Fellowship, the Alexander von Humboldt Prize and the gold medal of the Czech Academy of Sciences. He was a fellow of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and served as president of the American Society of Naturalists and vice president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. \r\n\r\nThe majority of Pittendrigh's scientific career was devoted to studies of the biology of daily rhythms, the \"biological clocks\" in most organisms, which function approximately in time with the 24-hour cycles of daylight and darkness. These circadian rhythms are responsible for jetlag in humans, for the fact that mice feed at night and squirrels in daytime, and for the fact that birds can navigate unerringly across vast distances. \r\n\r\nPittendrigh showed that most organisms maintain a rhythm or periodicity, even in the absence of external clues such as light and temperature. His studies led to the insight that the time-keeping mechanism involves a primary clock, or pacemaker, synchronized with secondary clocks that tell the organism when to start specific actions. \r\n\r\nPittendrigh continued his studies of biological clocks after his retirement from Stanford in 1984; he was working on a new paper at the time of his death. He was an avid fly fisherman, and Margaret Pittendrigh said that the couple retired to Bozeman because of their love of the Rocky Mountain high country. During his years in Montana, Pittendrigh maintained an elder statesman relationship with the science faculty at Montana State University-Bozeman, and was often called upon to lecture. \r\n\r\n",

"Biography":"PRINCETON, N.J. -- Aaron Lemonick, a physicist, gifted teacher and longtime University administrator who played a pivotal role in building Princeton's faculty, died Thursday, June 19, at age 80.\r\n\r\nLemonick, whose association with Princeton began as a graduate student in the early 1950s, served as dean of the Graduate School from 1969 to 1973 and then as dean of the faculty from 1973 to 1989. His great personal warmth and deep devotion to excellence in teaching and research helped drive an important period of strengthening and growth of the University's faculty in both the sciences and the humanities. \r\n\r\nThroughout his career, Lemonick was a dedicated teacher, whose bold classroom style and caring mentorship inspired generations of physicists as well as non-scientists. He worked until shortly before his death on preparations for this summer's Quest program, a series of workshops for elementary and middle school science teachers in which he planned to lead a unit on astronomy.\r\n\r\n\"For five decades Aaron Lemonick was one of the most beloved members of the Princeton family, as a graduate student, teacher, physicist and dean,\" said President Shirley M. Tilghman. \"He was one of our most gifted teachers of students, of alumni, of school teachers and others, and he played a central role in shaping the Princeton of the late 20th and early 21st century. He embodied the principles and values to which we aspire as a University and was a warm and genuine friend to many Princetonians. We will miss him greatly.\"\r\n\r\nAfter serving in the Air Force during World War II, Lemonick attended the University of Pennsylvania as an undergraduate and then came to Princeton for graduate work in physics and received a Ph.D. in 1954. Lemonick taught at Haverford College and became chair of the college's physics department in 1957. A specialist in nuclear and elementary particle physics, he also worked as a research collaborator at Brookhaven National Laboratory. He joined the Princeton faculty as an associate professor of physics in 1961. \r\n\r\nLemonick's ability to combine his insights into physics with his gift for working with others became apparent in his earliest research projects, colleagues recalled. In the early 1960s, Lemonick worked on the planning and construction of the Princeton-Penn Accelerator, a particle accelerator that yielded several important discoveries in physics. \"He had a very good ability to spot the important things on which to concentrate in solving a problem,\" said longtime colleague and emeritus professor of physics Frank Shoemaker. Almost immediately, Lemonick also began helping to coordinate the research among the physicists who used the machine and proved to be an effective administrator, Shoemaker said.\r\n\r\nIn his two deans posts, Lemonick was a tireless leader, said William Bowen, who served as president of Princeton from 1972 to 1988. He worked closely with department leaders to build their budgets and to recruit and retain faculty members. A key innovation was Lemonick's creation and use of a \"target of opportunity\" fund that allowed the University to act quickly in recruiting internationally valued scholars, said Bowen.\r\n\r\nWith Lemonick's support, several departments, including molecular biology, mathematics and philosophy, went through important periods of growth or renewal, Bowen said. \"Many of the people who are leaders of the faculty today came up through the ranks or were brought in under Aaron's leadership.\"\r\n\r\n\"He was a wonderful colleague -- always thoughtful, loyal and totally committed to the mission of the University,\" said Bowen. \"Most of all, for me, he was a warm friend. How grateful I am to have known him.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1989, Lemonick returned full time to his passion of teaching. The University honored him with the President's Award for Distinguished Teaching upon his retirement in 1994. In 2001, Princeton awarded him an honorary doctor of science degree.\r\n\r\n\"Aaron Lemonick was a thoughtful and conscientious academic leader and a greatly loved teacher, especially of introductory level physics courses,\" said Dean of the Faculty Joseph Taylor, who credits Lemonick's freshman physics course at Haverford with convincing him to choose physics over mathematics. Taylor went on to receive the 1993 Nobel Prize in physics.\r\n\r\nLemonick's enthusiasm in the classroom was infectious, Taylor said. \"Students assigned to other sections would often crowd extra chairs into his classroom so that they could attend his discussion section, as well as their own.\"\r\n\r\nAfter retiring, Lemonick continued to pursue his passion by joining the Princeton Teacher Preparation Program's Quest initiative, which offers science workshops to school teachers. He served as the director of Quest and taught workshops in astronomy and electricity and magnetism until his death.\r\n\r\n\"He had a way making the complex understandable,\" said John Webb, director of the Teacher Preparation Program. \"The teachers he worked with loved him, not only because they felt they were in the presence of a gracious scholar and expert but because he had a sense of wonderment about the phenomena of life and the universe that he was able to communicate to them. \r\n\r\n\"It made them feel empowered to explore those phenomena, to question them,\" Webb said. \"As a result, his impact on them was significant, both intellectually and emotionally. There is a whole group of young people now going through school and college who were the beneficiaries of that sense of wonderment and empowerment that Aaron gave to their teachers.\"\r\n\r\nLemonick also volunteered as a tutor for high school students in physics and served on the boards of several organizations, including the Princeton University Press, Bryn Mawr College, the Princeton Adult School and the Princeton Day School.\r\n\r\nLemonick, who was married to the late Eleanor Leah Drutt, is survived by his two sons, Michael and David. A funeral service will be held at the Mather-Hodge Funeral Home in Princeton at 1:30 p.m. Sunday, June 22. A memorial service on campus will be planned for the fall. Donations may be made to the Friends of the Princeton Public Library.\r\n \r\n  \r\n",

"Biography":"Alvin Kernan has gone far from his boyhood spent in the harsh world of the mountains of southern Wyoming. Growing up on the remote family homestead outside Saratoga during the grim years of the Depression, there was little hint of the distinguished future ahead of him. \r\n\r\nKernan left Wyoming to spend five years in the Navy during World War Two. Epitomizing the \"greatest generation,\" he earned both the Navy Cross and the Distinguished Flying Cross and later wrote passionately in tribute to his fellow servicemen. After the war, he excelled at Williams College where he earned his first bachelor's degree and again at Exeter College at Oxford University where he earned his second bachelor's degree while on a Moody Fellowship. During his masters, doctoral, and early professorial work at Yale University, he set a course for becoming America's eminent scholar of Shakespeare and the Renaissance.\r\n\r\nKernan's early books on satire and editions of Shakespeare and Ben Johnson brought acclaim, and his classes and seminars at Yale produced a generation of eminent scholars. Appointed to the Provost's office at Yale, Kernan excelled as an administrator, and he was subsequently invited to Princeton University where he served as Dean of the Graduate School, A.W. Mellon Professor of Humanities, and Avalon University Professor of Humanities. After returning to the classroom, he continued to write scores of books and articles on topics ranging from the Elizabethans and the authors of the eighteenth century to definitive pieces on literary forms and institutions. During the crises in the humanities of the late twentieth century, he wrote with dignity about the enduring values embodied in literature. Today, Kernan is celebrated as a war hero, a scholar, a teacher, a thoughtful critic, a passionate advocate of the humanities, and a truly Renaissance man of virtue.\r\n\r\nFor all of your contributions, Alvin Kernan, we are honored to bestow upon you the degree of Doctor of Letters, honoris causa\r\n\r\n",

"Biography":"Frederic Ewing Fox is known as the only man to hold the title “Keeper of Princetoniana\"at Princeton University, and also served as a Special Assistant in the White House, and as Staff Assistant to President Dwight D. Eisenhower.\r\n\r\nHe was born in Stanford, Connecticut and attended schools in Scarsdale, New York and Asheville, North Carolina and received his degree from Princeton University in 1939. In 1941 he enlisted in the U.S. Army and served in the European Theater of Operations under General Dwight D. Eisenhower as a captain in the Signal Corps until 1945. After being honorably discharged he attended the Union Theological Seminary and Defiance College[2] He went on to become pastor of four Congregational Churches in Arizona, New York, Ohio and Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nHe was brought to the attention of President Eisenhower through his articles in the New York Times on American community life. In 1956 he became a Special Assistant in the White House; and from 1957 to January 1961 he served as Staff Assistant to the President. In 1964 he became the Recording Secretary at Princeton University and served in that position until 1981.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFred Fox returned to Princeton in 1964 as its second Recording Secretary, responsible for the registration of gifts to Princeton. Over the years, Fox enlarged his role at Princeton, lecturing to a generation of first-year students and staff about Princeton's legends, myths, colors, artifacts, sons, stories, and people. In 1976 Fox became Keeper of Princetoniana, moving to Nassau Hall where he increased his work with alumni, friends of Princeton, and the public at large. Fox's contribution to Princeton is best enunciated in President William G. Bowen's memorial remarks {hot link} about this \"colorful, delightful person\" who was described as \"a cross between a curator, a ringmaster, and a storyteller.\" \r\nFox worked briefly for the National Broadcasting Company in California before enlisting in the Army and winning the Bronze Star as a signal officer during World War II. After the war, he earned a divinity degree at Union Theological Seminary and subsequently served Congregational churches in Arizona, New York, Ohio, Massachusetts, and Washington, D.C. Fox's writing, including articles in The New York Times Magazine, caught the eye of Dwight Eisenhower's staff, who hired him as speechwriter and liaison to volunteer organizations in Ike's second administration. In 1961, Fox traveled to Northern Rhodesia as a missionary\/teacher. \r\nRemembering Frederic E. Fox '39\r\nKeeper of Princetoniana\r\nby William G. Bowen *58\r\nIn his characteristic way, Frederic E. Fox '39 planned his own Memorial Service, even to the extent of choosing the hymns and scriptures and asking his friends in the Band to be present and to play a medley of Princeton songs as a postlude. He made provision in the Order of Service for \"Personal Remarks,\" but I think I should say (for otherwise legitimate doubt might exist) that he did not draft them-an exercise of what must have been, for Fred, remarkable restraint!\r\nHow much I loved him. How much so many loved him: for himself, of course, but also for what he represented. In coming together today, we cannot conceal the loss we have suffered, the loss we feel so deeply. It would be dishonest to try too hard to do so. But we come, primarily to celebrate his life among us, to give thanks, and then to go forward in song and in his good spirit to serve the causes so dear to him, including of course the cause of Princeton.\r\nWords can illuminate; they can help to define; they can offer some comfort. Fred himself was a master with words-written on paper, inscribed on bronze and stone. He was a skillful editor; drawing his inspiration from gardening, he used to tell me that editing was like weeding. But there are no words I can find that will do justice to Fred's life and works; to his devotion to Hannah and his family, classmates, and friends all over the world; to his responsiveness to others; to the texture, the tone, and the substance of all that he did.\r\nFred loved fairy tales, and he once wrote one about himself that provides the best short description of the long sweep of his activities. It reads as follows:\r\nOnce upon a time, there was a little boy who came to Princeton and lived happily ever after.\r\nAs an undergraduate, dressed up in a tiger skin, he crashed the gates of Palmer Stadium and cavorted on the field with the Band.\r\nDuring the war, dressed up like a soldier, he, gathered a helmetful of invasion currency from a group of alumni on board a landing ship off the Normandy coast, and sent it back to the university to build a new gym and library.\r\nWhen peace came, dressed up like a clergyman, he helped edit the hymnbook now used in the Chapel, making sure it contained at least three hymns written by Princetonians.\r\nIn the White House, dressed up like a Republican, he drafted messages for D. D. Eisenhower LLD. '17 in the nation's service.\r\nFinally, returning home as secretary of the distinguished Class of 1939, he became the only man in history to climb above the belfry of Nassau Hall, and put a 1939 nickel in the gold ball at the top of the pole just below the weather vane.\r\nThen, in 1976, after having served for 12 years as recording secretary of the university, Fred became, in his words: \"Keeper of Princeton's legends, songs and symbols.\"\r\nHis office, he said, was \"a showroom for Archives, a variety store of orange and black, an historical hangout, an information booth, a one-man speakers bureau, ombudsman, post office, bank, bar, and pastor's study.\" As many will testify, the most extraordinary array of people sought him out: to present a gift, to ask advice, to gather information, or simply to be with him. They were of all ages and all persuasions, some of them the most unlikely visitors to 1 Nassau Hall (which Fred once described as \"the ultimate address\"). And of course students, alumni, and friends also enjoyed the warmest hospitality at the Foxes' home at 28 Vandeventer. Life was for Fred, and his family, a whole cloth.\r\nFred was once prevailed upon to complete-of all things antithetical to his character-a \"position description and analysis form\" that provided fascinating insights into the work of our illustrious Keeper of Princetoniana. A colleague, in reviewing the form, had the good sense to observe: \"In significant respects, the position and the incumbent defy classification, and that is as it should be.\" Fred's submission was also described as \"an awesome illustration of the difference that one dedicated individual can make to the life of an institution.\" Fred listed 161 separate functions involving students, faculty, alumni, and friends, written material of all kinds, and an indescribable assortment of memorabilia. Included on his list was \"Soothed Yale professor whose bulldog was stolen by our undergraduates. Petted his dog.\" Also: \"Barraged various offices with suggestions ... on how to run the university.\" And: \"Sent Princeton University Press book on the birds of Venezuela to amateur ornithologist, Robert Keeley '51, the new Ambassador to Zimbabwe.\" The final item on his list was: \"Planted a few zinnias and marigolds alongside Nassau Hall. Keep watering them. \" \r\nFred was unfailingly colorful, and two particular colors were of course his favorites. \"Obviously I can't touch everyone, every event, with my magic wand dipped in orange and black\" he said, \"but as long as I'm Keeper of Princetoniana, I'm sure going to try. I hope I don't tip over the paint in the process.\"\r\nOver the years, his orange and black magic wand assumed international, indeed extraterrestrial, proportions. With Hannah's help, he sent a homemade Princeton banner to the moon with Pete Conrad '53 as a way, he said, of putting Princeton 239,000 miles ahead of Harvard and Yale. While in Red Square in Moscow with other members of his class, he painted two cobblestones orange and black. When Japanese visitors came to campus he taught them the words to \"Old Nassau,\" substituting \"banzai, banzai, banzai\" for \"hurrah, hurrah, hurrah\"; and he inspired them to sing with as much enthusiasm as he elicited from entering students each fall in Alexander Hall and from alumni at the conclusion of each P-rade.\r\nAlthough he considered himself the vice president for intangibles, Fred made the traditions and the legends of Princeton come alive in decidedly tangible ways. As he had done in the White House, so too at Princeton he seldom let anyone leave his office without carrying away some remembrance. When our daughter, Karen, went to interview him about his experiences in World War II for a high school social sciences project, she came home with a packet of sand from the beaches of Normandy. When Nassau Hall was being remodeled, he \"rescued\" a steel crossbeam and dragged it behind his bike to the physics workshop to have it sliced into paperweights. I have one on my desk. He had bricks and mortar and pieces of old fireplaces, and orange and black lollipops, and orange and black balloons which he gave to young and old alike. And he sent packages of Food Services Tiger sugar to occasionally bitter correspondents to sweeten their dispositions.\r\nCertainly one of Fred's most remarkable qualities was the way in which he provided a link among the generations. He was loved and respected in all the Princeton classes. At the same time, it is only fair to acknowledge his special relationship with his own class, which he served as secretary for 17 years. It is those in '39, of course, who knew Fred first and longest, and who remember with particular clarity the impression he made on this campus from the moment he arrived: the time he agreed to have his head shaved as a walking advertisement for Jack Honore's barbershop; the time he sneaked into the junior Prom through the steam pipes; and the time he made his way past the ticket-taker at a Theatre Intime, production in the garb of a Western Union messenger. Fred always insisted that his name was Frederic Fox '39, and that any Princeton name was incomplete without its numerals.\r\nThe picture of Fred that emerges from such wonderful stories-and there are so many more that could be told-is of a colorful, delightful person who cheered all who passed his way. It is a true picture; but it is also only a partial one. He was so much more than that.\r\nWithin the university, he was especially valuable in insisting on the human scale of the place, in resisting bureaucratic tendencies even as he understood the need for orderly procedures. When asked to draw an organizational chart that would place his activities in their right structural context, he did just that-but he did it by drawing arrows to all sorts of colleagues, allies, and semi-supervisors, and his chart culminated in clear pictorial recognition of Hannah's overarching role and the special place of his family in his life. He had a clear sense of his own priorities.\r\nHe also had a much more subtle sense of tradition than all the orange and black trappings might have suggested to some. His symbol of tradition, of continuity, was the river, because it was never stagnant, never still, always moving. He believed so deeply in the core values of Princeton that he became incensed when people mistook the trappings for the real thing and tried to preserve the form at the expense of the substance.\r\nHe was a person of real depth, and one of his greatest gifts was the ability to make important points with such a deceptively light touch that his students-and we were all his students-learned lessons without ever knowing that any \"teaching\" had occurred. It is no accident that he taught \"Old Nassau\" to the freshmen in Alexander Hall as part of a presentation on the Honor System, and his inimitable description of the song as reflecting Princeton's commitment to musical as well as intellectual integrity made a lasting impression on many.\r\nHe and I talked often about religion at Princeton. Characteristically, he brought to these discussions his understanding of the views of others as well as his own clear convictions. I know how hard he worked to encourage a larger range of opportunities for religious observance, a broader conception of the role of religion in the life of the university, at the same time that he was so faithful to his own beliefs as an ordained minister and a devout Christian. He had no use for bigotry in any form. His sense of this university's religious tradition was secure enough and generous enough to infuse his view of the Chapel and its place on this campus with a broad perspective.\r\nAs many current students and graduates in all classes will testify, Fred was also deeply committed to extracurricular activities of many kinds-especially to Triangle and the Band. He saw these activities not just as opportunities for fun-much as he approved of having fun-but as unifying elements, as carriers of the right kind of spirit, and as learning opportunities. He was a strong supporter of recent efforts to improve residential life, believing as he did in the value of friendships that include all within what must be finally a single community.\r\nFred could of course be wrong-a trait he shared with each of us. In fact, I think he had the capacity to be even more outrageously wrong than most, perhaps because he was more creative and less inhibited In any event, he knew full well that certain of his judgments had to be checked from time to time, and Dennis Sullivan '70 in my office used to exercise what he called his \"desk drawer veto\" of some of Fred's proposals. But if he could be wrong, he could not be arrogant; and so another lesson he taught us was humility.\r\nAt the same time, he was also, on occasion, a very tough adversary. This past weekend, I read again copies of some of his letters, generally written to critics of Princeton whom Fred regarded as not only backward-looking but, far worse from his standpoint, unloving.\r\nOne of Fred's strongest qualities was his unremitting desire to be constructive: to build, not to tear down. He was in his person a great antidote to the occasional waves of cynicism that can wash over all of us, and he always tried to find a graceful way to aim concern in a positive direction.\r\nHe buoyed our spirits, he breathed his zest for life into us, and he quickened our steps along the way. I think of Fred particularly as I remember what Adlai Stevenson '22 once said of Eleanor Roosevelt: \"She would rather light a candle than curse the darkness.\"\r\nI have left to the last that characteristic of Fred that I think was most important. He was, for me and so many others, a pastor. A member of his class observed, \"he baptized us, he married us, he buried us.\" As others, from all classes, will testify, he helped us celebrate our joys and he comforted us at times of distress. We always knew he was there. He could listen, and laugh, and cry. He taught by example that no small act of kindness is too small to count. The notes he has sent me, over the years, are among my special treasures. I know I am not alone in that regard.\r\nFred has also been described, especially these last few days, as \"irreplaceable.\" In a real sense he is. But he would have been offended, I think, disappointed in us, if we could not, together, sustain the infectious enthusiasm for Princeton that is surely a large part of his legacy. That is a charge for each of us-not to copy Fred (an effort certain to fail) but in our own ways, within our own capacities, to carry forward his vision of Princeton as a place of learning and of the spirit, a human place, where each person is in the care of all.\r\nFinally, as we commemorate Fred's life today, we should remember his efforts to commemorate the lives of others. Fred always sent each Class Memorial in the Princeton Alumni Weekly to the spouse or next of kin with a personal note. When he was recording secretary, he wrote the words that I still use frequently to conclude letters of condolence. Now it is our turn to say good-bye to him. He was our pastor, he was our friend, he was a light to our lives and to the life of this university. To use again his words, most appropriately of all applied to him: \"Princeton holds in honor and affection the name of Frederic E. Fox, Class of 1939.\" \r\nThis is adapted from President William G. Bowen's remarks at Fox's Memorial Service in the University Chapel on February 25, 1981. Used with the kind permission of William G. Bowen, the Princeton Alumni Weekly in which this first appeared, and the Princeton University Press, publisher of Ever the Teacher: William G.

Before Raboteau was born, his father was killed by a white man who was never convicted of the crime.[1] His mother moved from the South where she was a teacher, and moved to find a better place for her children.[1] She remarried to an African American priest. Raboteau's stepfather taught him Latin and Greek starting at five years old, and also helped him focus on church and education. He was accepted into college at the age of sixteen. He entered the Yale Graduate Program in Religious Studies, where he studied with American religious historian Sydney Ahlstrom and African American historian John Blassingame. Raboteau's dissertation, later revised and published as the book Slave Religion: The \"Invisible Institution\" in the Antebellum South, was published just as the black studies movement was gaining steam in the 1970s and in the wake of revolutionary scholarship on American slavery: Olli Alho's The Religion of Slaves (1976), Blassingame's Slave Community (1972) and Slave Testimony (1977), Eugene Genovese's Roll, Jordan, Roll (1974), and Lawrence Levine's Black Culture and Black Consciousness (1977).[2]\r\n\r\nIn 1982 Princeton University hired Raboteau, first as a visiting professor and then as full-time faculty. He is currently (2009) Henry W. Putnam Professor of Religion. His research and teaching focus on American Catholic history, African American religions, and religion and immigration issues. He chaired the Department of Religion (1987-1992) and also served as dean of the Graduate School (1992-1993). He received the Lifetime Service Award (Journey Award) in both 2005 and 2006. In 2005, he also received the special Achievement Award (Journey Award). He has subsequently converted to Eastern Orthodoxy.\r\n(Wikapedia 9\/10\/09)\r\n",

"Biography":"Richard Hunt (born September 12, 1935) is an internationally renowned sculptor.\r\n\r\nHe was born in 1935 on Chicago's South Side. From an early age he was interested in the arts, as his mother was an artist. As a young boy, Hunt began to show enthusiasm and talent in artistic disciplines such as drawing and painting, and also sculpture, an interest that grew more and more as he got older. He developed his skills at the Junior School of the Art Institute and later at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Hunt also acquired business sense and awareness of social issues from working for his father in a barbershop.\r\n\r\nHunt began to experiment with materials and sculpting techniques, influenced heavily by progressive twentieth-century artists. This experimentation garnered critically positive response from the art community, such that Hunt was exhibited at the Artists of Chicago and Vicinity Show and the American Show, where the Museum of Modern Art purchased a piece for its collection. He was the youngest artist to exhibit at the 1962 Seattle World's Fair, a major international survey exhibition of modern art.\r\n\r\nHunt has completed more public sculptures than any other artist in the country. His signature pieces include Jacob's Ladder at the Carter G. Woodson Library in Chicago and Flintlock Fantasy in Detroit. He was appointed by President Lyndon Johnson as one of the first artists to serve on the governing board of the National Endowment for the Arts and he also served on boards of the Smithsonian Institution. Hunt is the recipient of numerous awards and honorary degrees.\r\n\r\nHunt has continued to experiment throughout his successful career, employing a wide range of sculptural techniques. Through his work, Hunt often makes comments on contemporary social and political issues.\r\n\r\nWikipedia 10\/9\/09",

He's been the subject of over a dozen solo exhibitions (Museum Ludwig, Portikus, Kustverein in Hamburg, and Friedrich Petzel Gallery, among others), and the work he produces in collaboration with Kelley Walker, under the moniker Walker\/Guyton, has also been shown widely (Portikus, Greene Naftali Gallery, Venice Biennale).  The number of group exhibitions in which Guyton has participated is extraordinary given his relatively young age; they include venues such as MoMA, the Miami Art Museum, the Turin Triennale, the Hammer Museum, White Columns, the Contemporary Art Museum of Lyon, Modern Art Oxford, the Serpentine Gallery, and the Sculpture Center.  Guyton's work can be found in the collections of the AIC, MoMA, SF MoMA, the Pompidou, and the Whitney, among others.",

"Biography":"Active since the early 1990s, Aiken is one of the most prominent artists working in video and video installation today.  His videos are cinematic in scale and effect, with high production values, while their sensibility is at once magisterial, mesmerizing, and mysterious, calling to mind that of other, highly regarded artists, including Pierre Huyghe, Tacita Dean, Anri Sala, and Teresa Hubbard and Alexander Birchler.  Like the latter, moreover, Aitken excels at creating non-linear, non-synchronous narratives, narratives whose gaps, returns, and repetitions complement the subjects he explores, such as the physical and psychological relationship between human beings and space, both natural and urban.",

"Biography":"From Wikipedia: \r\n\r\nHarris & Ewing Inc. was a photographic studio in Washington, D.C., owned and run by George W. Harris and Martha Ewing. As a rookie news photographer, Harris covered the Johnstown, Pa., flood of 1889. He worked at Hearst News Service in San Francisco from 1900 to 1903, then joined Roosevelt's press entourage on a train trip. According to the studio's nomination to the National Register of Historic Places, \"the president personally urged him to start a photographic news service in Washington because it was so difficult at that time for out-of-town newspapers to get timely photographs of notable people and events in the Nation's Capital.\" In 1905, Harris and Ewing opened their studio at 1313 F Street NW in Washington. (As of 2014, the studio name was still visible on the building). In 1955, the company gave some 700,000 glass and film negatives to the Library of Congress, which preserves them as the Harris & Ewing Collection in the Prints and Photographs Division. Largely taken in and around Washington between 1905 and 1945, the photos portray people, events, and architecture. Many are scanned and online. Harris died in 1964 at age 92.",

"Biography":"A graduate of Hunter College, from which he received an MFA in 2006, Zach Harris is an emerging artist with a long career ahead of him. He is known for a series of exquisite mixed-media assemblages that combine painted elements with carved and cut pieces of wood. A consummate craftsman, Harris labors over each work for a year or more. His paintings are as meticulously rendered as his sculpted and assembled frames, which he treats as an integral part of the work. Indeed, he makes no distinction between painting and frame: they are of a piece with one another. Slightly larger than a Byzantine icon, Harris's works are intimately scaled. They are neither fully abstract nor completely representational: the imagery is evocative, usually of trees, landscapes, and fire, but it is never tied to a specific referent. \r\n\r\nAccording to Harris, his work serves as a kind of meditative device: it is meant to grip the mind via the eye and to trigger moments of imaginative reverie, if not flights of spiritual and metaphysical fancy. His choice of palette, motif, and composition all serve this end: intensity-intensity of impact, of color, and of symbolism-is always prized, along with tactility. In these and other ways, Harris's work departs radically from a great deal of contemporary painting, which tends to be monumental in scale, short on affect, and reliant on photographs and digital technology.",

Though forgotten (in the tradition of celebrity photographers) by later generations, Falk played a central role in the nascent publicity machines of Gilded-Age and ragtime New York. Besides being the first photographer to depict a theatrical performance in process (in 1883, using electric lighting at Madison Square Theater), he was a canny competitor and successor to Napoleon Sarony (whom he outdid in portraying strongman Eugene Sandow as Hercules), an elder rival to Edward Steichen and Adolph De Meyer, and a stylistic progenitor of Fabian Bachrach-who, as an apprentice in Falk's studio, learned to deploy electric lighting to sculptural effect.",

"Biography":"Born in Cairo, Illinois, Hale Woodruff studied at the John Herron Art Institute in Indianapolis, before going to Paris in 1927 thanks to a grant from the philanthropic William E. Harmon Foundation, which assisted African Americans for distinguished achievements in the fine arts.  After four years in Paris, which provided him with the foundation for what he would call his \"semiabstract symbolic painting\" style, he accepted an art instructorship at the newly formed Atlanta University Center (comprising Atlanta University, Morehouse and Spelman Colleges), where he remained until 1945, when he joined the faculty at NYU.  Before he retired in 1967, Woodruff co-founded the civil rights-inspired artists' collective Spiral with Romare Bearden, who later described him as a \"seminal figure\" in twentieth century American art.

"Biography":"“The plastic photographic case industry began with Scovill Manufacturing Company of Waterbury, Connecticut, and the daguerreotypist, Samuel Peck. […] One early supplier for cases to the Scovills was Samuel Peck of New Haven, Connecticut, who began his career as a daguerreotype artist in 1844. By 1850 he was manufacturing cases and soon began a co-partnership with the Scovills that was named Peck and Company. In addition to leather and paper cases, peck began creating “fine cases” including those made from papier-maché. Perhaps it was the technique used in making these cases which inspired Peck to his greatest innovation. By May of 1852 Samuel Peck and his brother-in-law, Halvor Halvorson began producing daguerreotype cases molded from plastic.” p. 1421, Encyclopedia of 19th-century Photography.",

From then, he photographed the work of nearly every modernist architect working in the United States, including Rudolph Schindler, John Lautner, Frank Lloyd Wright, Bruce Goff, and Gregory Ain. His published photographs did much to promote the \"international style\" ca. 1936-1970, and illuminated the role of modernist architecture in its environmental context. His archive is held by the J.

Taking their name from the forceful Spanish word for disgust and nausea, Asco used performance, public art, and multimedia to respond to social and political turbulence in Los Angeles and beyond. ASCO remained active until the mid-1980s, contracting and expanding to include Diane Gamboa, Sean Carrillo, Daniel J. Martinez, and Teddy Sandoval, among others. (LACMA)",

"Biography":"The artist was a member of the National Society of Mural Painters and the Architectural League. He was also an instructor in painting and drawing at University of Louisville, Parsons School of Design, Columbia University, and University of Washington. Between 1965 and his death on December 14, 1973, he divided his time between New York City, where he taught at the Art Students League and Venice, a city of artistic inspiration where he focused on sculpture. \r\n\r\nNamed in Life magazine in 1950 as one of the best young American artists, Melcarth exhibited as a painter, draftsman and sculptor and also practiced as an illustrator, photographer and designer. His work survives in the Forbes Collection, in the Smithsonian Institution and in the art archives at the Kinsey Institute. (Kinsey even consulted with Melcarth, circa 1947, on the role of sex in art.) According to authors Griffey and Reay, who wrote on Melcarth and homoeroticism in modern American art for the History Workshop Journal in 2012, Melcarth’s vision of the erotic, realized in hundreds of images of the male nude, was far broader than the traditional categories of sexuality that are perpetuated in art histories of homoeroticism in modern America – and that such a revisioning enables a reinterpretation of some of the better known images of homosexual art.\r\n\r\nA prolific draftsman, Melcarth created numerous sketchbooks and portfolios of drawings. As a muralist, he executed the decorative program for the Rotunda of the Hotel Pierre and the ceiling of the Lunt Fontaine Theater – only the former can still be seen today. In addition, he worked on the lobby and auditorium of the Rooftop Theater, parts of the Time Life Building, and the IBM building.",

Rau reached greatest fame picturing the developed landscapes of the American East, spurred by his commissions from the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Lehigh Valley Railroad to document their vast miles of track. Rau began his career as a successful expeditionary photographer in the American West and abroad, popularizing his journeys in the form of stereo cards and lantern slides. Rau’s first photographs related to industrialization documented the displays at the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia. After opening his own studio in 1886 in the same city, Rau not only achieved fame through his railroad commissions, but as the official photographer of the St. Louis World’s Fair in 1904. Falling into obscurity after the rise of the Photo-Secession and artistic photography, Rau has received renewed attention in recent years as an exemplar of the mutually beneficial relationship between photographers and the railroad industry in the Gilded Age.",

Allora received a BA from the University of Richmond in Virginia (1996) and an MS from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (2003); Calzadilla received a BFA from Escuela de Artes Plásticas, San Juan, Puerto Rico (1996) and an MFA from Bard College (2001). \r\nCollaborating since 1995, Allora & Calzadilla approach visual art as a set of experiments that test whether ideas such as authorship, nationality, borders, and democracy adequately describe today’s increasingly global and consumerist society. Their hybridized works—often a unique mix of sculpture, photography, performance, sound and video—explore the physical and conceptual act of mark making and its survival through traces. By drawing historical, cultural, and political metaphors out of basic materials, Allora & Calzadilla’s works explore the complex associations between an object and its meaning. \r\n\r\nAbove information taken from Art:21 http:\/\/www.pbs.org\/art21\/artists\/alloracalzadilla\/index.html\r\n\r\n",

"Biography":"Short on funds and waiting to receive a commission from the United States Congress to survey the route for a transcontinental railroad, an idea which he is credited with originating, civil engineer John Plumbe, Jr., took up photography in 1840 after seeing the work of an itinerant daguerreotypist in Washington, D.C. A Welshman by birth, Plumbe opened a gallery in Boston the following year. He eventually maintained galleries in thirteen cities, making his name recognizable in numerous cities across the country. Plumbe opened his Washington, D.C., gallery in 1844, the first in the nation's capital. By the time he established the National Plumbeotype Gallery of engraved and lithographic reproductions of his own images in 1846, Plumbe had been dubbed \"the American Daguerre\" by the press. In 1847 Plumbe found himself in financial trouble and he sold his business to his employees. Two years later he gave up photography and retired to Dubuque, Iowa, where he met an untimely end by cutting his own throat. (Getty Museum)",

Abbott earned his undergraduate degree at Bowdoin College before he studied physics at Harvard University, along with the museum's first director, Alfred Hamilton Barr, Jr.. He then taught at Bowdoin from 1921 to 1922 before he studied art history classes at Princeton University. After having helped establish a department of fine arts at Wesleyan University in 1929, he helped establish the museum in New York. He became the associate director of the museum at the time of its founding in 1929 and retained that position until 1932 when he became the director of the Smith College Museum of Art in Northampton, Massachusetts. He remained at Smith, both as the museum's director and as an art history teacher, until he retired in 1946. \r\n\r\nAbove information taken from: http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jere_Abbott\r\nand http:\/\/www.dictionaryofarthistorians.org\/abbottj.htm\r\n\r\nJere Abbott, the first associate director of the Museum of Modern Art at the time of its founding in 1929, died July 9 in Plummer Memorial Hospital in Dexter, Me., where he was a resident. He was 84 years old. Mr. Abbott was a college classmate and close friend of the late Alfred Hamilton Barr, the museum's first director. Mr. Abbott was on the museum's staff until March 1932, when he was appointed director of the Smith College Museum of Art in Northampton, Mass. He was also a member of the faculty, teaching modern art until his retirement in 1946. The Abbott family operated the Amos Abbott Woolen Manufacturing Company in Dexter, and Mr. Abbott served as its treasurer when he returned to live at the family home. Mr. Abbott held a Bachelor of Science degree from Bowdoin College and did postgraduate work at Harvard University, studying physics, and later at Princeton University, where he studied art history.

"Biography":"Carl Ethan Akeley was a well-known naturalist and taxidermist who worked for many years at the American Museum of Natural History (1909-26). After his first trip to Africa in 1896, Akeley conceived the idea of creating a full-scale African diorama to show the animals in their natural habitat. The Wounded Comrade depicts a scene that Akeley had directly observed in the wild: when an elephant is wounded, others from the herd will rush in and attempt to convey it to safety. Akeley's production of art bronzes was the direct result of his working habit of making clay models to design dioramas. A fellow sculptor, Alexander Phimister Proctor (whose works are on exhibition nearby), suggested that Akeley cast a series of these models into bronze. The first and most famous work in the series is The Wounded Comrade. -- The Brooklyn Museum.\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nThe Akeley Hall of African Mammals is considered by many to be among the world's greatest museum displays. A monument to an area that has dramatically changed, the Hall is also a monument to Carl Akeley, the innovator who created it. Akeley was a dedicated explorer, taxidermist, sculptor, and photographer who led teams of scientists and artists on several expeditions to Africa during the first two decades of this century. There, he and his colleagues carefully studied, catalogued, and collected the plants and animals that even then were disappearing. He brought many specimens of that world back to the Museum, where he created this hall, with its twenty-eight dioramas.\r\n\r\nThe dioramas do not simply evoke the sites that Akeley visited -- they replicate specific animals in specific geographic locations at a specific time. In creating these works, Akeley forever changed the practice of taxidermy -- the stuffing and mounting of the skins of animals. Until then animal skins had been stuffed with straw or wood shavings. Akeley, however, began by re-creating the animal's shape with an armature made of wood, wire, and sometimes parts of the actual skeleton. He then used clay to add on each muscle, tendon, and vein. When this work was complete, he made a cast of it, and fit the animal's skin over the cast. This meticulous attention to veracity -- which was carried over to the plant forms and even to the light in the dioramas -- resulted in faithful and vivid reproductions of the world that Akeley wanted to preserve.\r\n\r\nCarl Akeley died on an African expedition in 1926, ten years before this hall was completed. He was buried in a place depicted in the Hall's famous Gorilla Diorama. While we have learned a great deal about mammals and their world since Akeley's day, and we no longer collect animal specimens as Akeley did, his vision and his desire to preserve the world he lived in still inform much of the work done at the Museum. \r\n\r\n-- American Museum of Natural History\r\n",

"Biography":"In detailed representations of both great urban centers and rustic scenes of rural life, Grace Albee faithfully recorded the places she knew and loved during a career that spanned more than half of this century. The National Museum of Women in the Arts presents a retrospective exhibition of her wood engravings, Grace Albee: An American Printmaker, 1890-1985, on view through November 21, 1999. \r\n\r\nA native of Rhode Island, Albee and her family joined other expatriate Americans living in Paris between the World Wars. There she befriended fellow artists who contributed to her creative development, among them painter Norman Rockwell and engraver Paul Bornet. Albee rendered city scenes and picturesque views from her travels throughout France; her concentration on buildings in Brittany foreshadowed her later interest in rural architecture.\r\n\r\nShe returned to this country and worked during the 1930s in New York City, where the architecture of the changing city inspired her. In Contrast-Rockefeller Center (1934), Albee juxtaposed a Gothic church in the foreground with the dramatically lit skyscrapers beyond. In 1937, Albee and her family relocated to a farm near Doylestown, PA. There she included more intimate portrayals of her surroundings, such as the stone houses and farms of her neighbors. The Boyer Place (1946) shows her ability to capture the detail of the farm scape, from the slatted corn crib in the center to the great stone barn that looms over the scene. \r\n\r\nThe delicate textures of Albee's country grasses and wildflowers reveal her command of wood engraving. Coarse stones, aged wood, and rippled water appear almost touchable. In one of her earliest rural pieces, Housing Problem (1937), Albee's careful observation and composition evoke a humorous depiction of nomadic goats. It won first prize in the Fifteenth Annual Exhibition of American Prints at the Philadelphia Art Alliance in 1937.\r\n\r\nAlbee studied painting and drawing at the Rhode Island School of Design before marrying muralist Percy F. Albee in 1913. She resumed her artwork in the mid-1920s while she raised five sons. In 1946 she was elected a member of the National Academy of Design in New York City. In 1976 the Brooklyn Museum hosted a retrospective exhibition, displaying 80 of her works. Albee is represented in museum collections throughout the United States, with major holdings in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Brooklyn Museum, the Library of Congress, the Smithsonian Institution, and the Boston Public Library. \r\n\r\n-- National Museum of Women in the Arts",

"Biography":"Albers trained as an art teacher at Königliche Kunstschule in Berlin, Germany, from 1913 to 1915. From 1916 to 1919 he began his work as a printmaker at the Kunstgewerbschule in nearby Essen, Germany. In 1919 he went to Munich, Germany, to study at the Königliche Bayerische Akademie der Bildenden Kunst, where he was a pupil of Max Doerner and Frank Stuck. In 1920 he attended the preliminary course (Vorkurs) at the Bauhaus in Weimar, Germany, and was appointed a master in 1923 or 1925. In 1925 Albers moved with the Bauhaus to Dessau, Germany, where he was named master. From 1928 to 1930 he was also in charge of the furniture workshop. In 1932 he moved with the Bauhaus to Berlin. From 1933, after the closure of the Bauhaus in Berlin, until 1949, Albers taught at Black Mountain College in North Carolina. From 1948 to 1950 or from 1950 to 1958, Albers was professor and chairman of the Department of Design at Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut. He remained there as a visiting professor until 1960. After his retirement from Yale University, Albers continued to live in New Haven and to paint, monitor his own exhibitions and publications, write, lecture and work on large commissioned sculptures for architectural settings.

"Biography":"American painter and lithographer. He studied briefly with Alexander Robertson (1768–1841) in New York and copied portraits by John Trumbull and Samuel Waldo. From 1821 to 1825 he painted portraits in Killingly, CT, and Providence, RI. He received encouraging advice from Gilbert Stuart in Boston, probably in 1825, and by 1828 was a prominent portrait painter and lithographer there. Portraits such as Mrs Jared Sparks (1830; Cambridge, MA, Harvard U.) demonstrate a well-developed sense of pattern and design but display some deficiency in draughtsmanship, with conventional shapes used to determine the sitter’s features.\r\n\r\nFrom 1831 to 1833 Alexander travelled and painted in Italy. After returning to Boston, he exhibited 39 paintings in 1834 at Harding’s Gallery, many of which were derived from the Italian trip. His unusually theatrical portrait of Senator Daniel Webster (1835; Hanover, NH, Dartmouth Coll., Hood Mus. A.) shows the effect of his exposure to Romanticism; Webster is presented with fiery eyes and wild hair, silhouetted against a dramatic sky. When Dickens visited America in 1842, Alexander aggressively sought him out and depicted him as a slight youth (Dickens was 30) seated casually behind a large table (Boston, MA, Mus. F.A.).\r\n\r\nAlexander was made an honorary member of the National Academy of Design in New York in 1840. He returned to Italy in 1853, settling in Florence, where he collected early Renaissance art, gave up painting and became a friend of Hiram Powers, the leader of the city’s American art colony. He revisited America only once, in 1868–9. Most of the paintings in his collection, which included works attributed to Perugino, Orcagna and Ghirlandaio, were destroyed while in storage in Boston during the great fire of 1873; the remainder were sold at auction at Leonard & Co., Boston, in 1874. His daughter Esther Frances (1837–1917), known as Francesca, became a painter, illustrator and poet (GDA).",

"Biography":"Alexander’s stylistic development falls into several distinct stages. His early landscapes and genre scenes of the 1870s bear the stamp of Wilhelm Leibl’s Munich realism as espoused by Duveneck and William Merritt Chase. His fluid brushwork resembled that of Frans Hals and Diego Velázquez, painters he deeply admired. After his return to the USA in 1881 and under the influence of Whistler, he favoured a more limited palette and experimented with the evocation of mood through shadow and gesture. His portrait of Walt Whitman (1886–9; New York, Met.) is one of his finest works of the 1880s. Many of his later portraits, notably of women, were psychological studies rather than specific likenesses, as in The Ring (1911; New York, Met.). His brushwork became less painterly and more concerned with suggesting abstracted shapes. He also adopted a very coarse-weave canvas, the texture of which became an important element in his mature work. By applying thinned-down paint to the absorbent surface, his pictures appear to have been dyed in muted tones, in marked contrast to the glossy, impasted surfaces of his earlier work. Throughout his career Alexander favoured compositions with a single figure placed against a sharply contrasting background. The sinuous curvilinear outline of the heroine standing full-length in Isabella, or the Pot of Basil (1897; Boston, MA, Mus. F.A.) evokes contemporary Art Nouveau forms. Like the Symbolists, he sought by gesture and strong lighting to intensify the viewer’s response to his sensuous treatment of the subject (GDA).\r\n\r\n\r\nAmerican painter and illustrator. He began his career in New York in 1875 as a political cartoonist and illustrator for Harper's Weekly. In 1877 he went to Paris for his first formal art training, and then to Munich, where he enrolled at the Kunstakademie under Gyuala Bencz?r. In 1878 he joined a colony of American painters established by Frank Duveneck in Polling, Bavaria. In 1879 they travelled to Italy, where Alexander formed friendships with James McNeill Whistler and Henry James. In 1881 he returned to New York, working as an illustrator for Harper's, as a drawing instructor at Princeton and as a highly successful society portrait painter. He also exhibited at the National Academy of Design. By 1893 his reputation in both Europe and America had soared, and in 1895 he was awarded a prestigious commission for a series of murals entitled the Evolution of the Book in the newly established Library of Congress in Washington, DC. After 1901 Alexander became deeply involved with the promotion of the arts in America. He won numerous mural commissions (e.g. Pittsburgh, PA, Carnegie Inst.; from 1905, unfinished) and continued to paint portraits.\r\nhttp:\/\/www.answers.com\/topic\/john-white-alexander\r\n",

"Biography":"American painter and craftsman. After working briefly in Worcester, MA (1790–93), painting miniatures, chimney-pieces, signs and sleighs, he settled permanently in Albany, NY. There he practised various crafts, including framemaking and painting ornamental clockfaces. Active in the Masonic Temple, he held a high position in the New York chapter from 1802 to 1826. For the Masons he made signs, aprons, urns and carpet designs. Entries in his account books indicate that by 1813 he was primarily painting portraits, improving his technique by copying works by John Singleton Copley and Gilbert Stuart. His first major success was the sale of a portrait of George Clinton, Governor of New York and vice-president of the USA, to the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts (1812; destr. 1845). Laudatory reviews generated requests for replicas, including an ambitious but somewhat awkward full-length version (c. 1813; Albany, NY, State Capitol). Ames also painted the official portrait of George Clinton’s nephew, DeWitt Clinton as Governor of New York for the city of Albany (1817–18; on dep. Albany, NY, Inst. Hist. & A.). It is a half-length portrait and demonstrates his straightforward, factual style. Ames was elected to the American Academy of Fine Arts in 1824 but never exhibited in New York. Nearly 500 of his works, mainly portraits of people in New York state, have been recorded (GDA).",

"Biography":"American performance artist, sculptor, draughtsman and writer.

She then trained as a sculptor at Columbia University, New York, receiving her MFA in 1972. Her first performance, in which ‘music’ was played on car horns, took place in 1972 at Town Green in Rochester, NY. She continued to work primarily as a performance artist, using photographs, films, projected texts and, above all, music to create sophisticated and precisely staged events. The most complex and spectacular of these, United States, first performed in full at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York in 1983, was a four-part compendium of spoken texts and songs in which she addressed themes that she continued to explore in her later work, notably the use and abuse of language and of political power in its many forms (GDA).",

"Biography":"Japanese painter, performance artist and film maker active in the USA. He studied medicine and mathematics at Tokyo University (1954–8) and art at the Musashino College of Art in Tokyo, holding his first one-man exhibition at the National Museum of Modern Art in Tokyo in 1958 and contributing to the Yomiuri Independent exhibitions from 1958 to 1961. In 1960 he took part in the ‘anti-art’ activities of the Neo-dadaism organizers in Tokyo and produced his first Happenings and a series of sculptures entitled Boxes, which consisted of amorphous lumps of cotton wads hardened in cement; many of these were put in coffin-like boxes, though one entitled Foetus was laid on a blanket. In pointing to the sickness of contemporary society, these works caused a great scandal in Tokyo.\r\n\r\nIn 1961 Arakawa settled in New York, where soon afterwards he addressed himself to the idea of a work being ‘untitled’. In taking as his subject this apparent lack of subject, he emphasized the areas of the picture surface where the subject ‘ought to be’ by means of a few well-placed coloured framing marks, as in Untitledness No. 2 (1961–2; see 1979 exh. cat., pl. 1). These were followed by another series of paintings entitled Diagrams, which consist of the sprayed silhouettes of banal objects such as tennis- rackets, combs and gloves (e.g. A Card Becomes a Foot, 1964; see 1979 exh. cat., pl. 7). After thus alluding to the shadows cast by objects, he moved even further away from actual objects by replacing them with their names and cursory outlines, as in Alphabet Skin No. 2 (1966; see 1979 exh. cat., pl. 23). Characteristically this work incorporates a ‘mistake’ in the scrubbing out of one label and its replacement with the correct word with which to identify it. This laying bare of mistakes and second thoughts as a recurrent feature of his paintings underlines the fact that he conceives of them as visualizations of thought processes, and it acts as a reminder that any interpretation might be erroneous. Arakawa continued to explore the interrelationship between different forms of representation in a series of drawings and paintings entitled Webster’s Dictionary (1965–6; see 1979 exh. cat., pls 13, 14 and 18), in which reproductions of dictionary pages were altered so that only the initial word was legible. The definitions were scribbled out in various colours, paradoxically suggesting both that words were meaningless and also that they might have an equivalent in colour.\r\n\r\nMany of Arakawa’s works from 1963 to 1971 formed part of The Mechanism of Meaning, a series made in collaboration with the American poet Madeline H. Gins (b 1943). A set of reproductions of these works with short captions was published in book form in 1971: divided into 16 subsections, with titles such as ‘The Energy of Meaning’ and ‘Degrees of Meaning’, this was Arakawa’s most concentrated treatment of the nature of thought, language and representation. Real objects and stencilled texts were incorporated in some works of this period, often suggesting that the viewer engage in an apparently nonsensical activity; one instruction, for instance, found beneath a piece of cloth attached to the canvas, demands: ‘Before lifting this decide whether you have ever seen what is underneath.’ Arakawa also experimented with film making during this period, producing Why Not in 1969 and For Example (A Critique of Never) in 1971. Soon after The Mechanism of Meaning his paintings settled into a more consistent style characterized by intricate networks of lines, stencilled words and pale, transparent colours. These have the rational look of technical drawings and, like his previous works, defy complete understanding, as in the diptych Afternoon and Evening (1974; see 1979 exh. cat., pls 43–4), which on the afternoon panel contains the faint words: ‘the afternoon of\/each cleaving air\/every air of cleaving\/on the same afternoon\/of “to cleave”\/shape as “a nothing”\/or shape in nothing’. After producing other works, sometimes very large in scale, in a similar style, in the late 1970s and early 1980s he again investigated the idea of blankness, this time by using arrows and fragments of street maps, as in Blank Dots (1982; New York, Met.) (GDA).",

"Biography":"John James Audubon (1785-1851) was not the first person to attempt to paint and describe all the birds of America (Alexander Wilson has that distinction), but for half a century he was the young country’s dominant wildlife artist. His seminal Birds of America, a collection of 435 life-size prints, quickly eclipsed Wilson’s work and is still a standard against which 20th and 21st century bird artists, such as Roger Tory Peterson and David Sibley, are measured. \r\n\r\nAlthough Audubon had no role in the organization that bears his name, there is a connection: George Bird Grinnell, one of the founders of the early Audubon Society in the late 1800s, was tutored by Lucy Audubon, John James’s widow. Knowing Audubon’s reputation, Grinnell chose his name as the inspiration for the organization’s earliest work to protect birds and their habitats. Today, the name Audubon remains synonymous with birds and bird conservation the world over. \r\n\r\nAudubon was born in Saint Domingue (now Haiti), the illegitimate son of a French sea captain and plantation owner and his French mistress. Early on, he was raised by his stepmother, Mrs. Audubon, in Nantes, France, and took a lively interest in birds, nature, drawing, and music. In 1803, at the age of 18, he was sent to America, in part to escape conscription into the Emperor Napoleon’s army. He lived on the family-owned estate at Mill Grove, near Philadelphia, where he hunted, studied and drew birds, and met his wife, Lucy Bakewell. While there, he conducted the first known bird-banding experiment in North America, tying strings around the legs of Eastern Phoebes; he learned that the birds returned to the very same nesting sites each year. \r\n\r\nAudubon spent more than a decade in business, eventually traveling down the Ohio River to western Kentucky – then the frontier – and setting up a dry-goods store in Henderson. He continued to draw birds as a hobby, amassing an impressive portfolio. While in Kentucky, Lucy gave birth to two sons, Victor Gifford and John Woodhouse, as well as a daughter who died in infancy. Audubon was quite successful in business for a while, but hard times hit, and in 1819 he was briefly jailed for bankruptcy. \r\n\r\nWith no other prospects, Audubon set off on his epic quest to depict America’s avifauna, with nothing but his gun, artist’s materials, and a young assistant. Floating down the Mississippi, he lived a rugged hand-to-mouth existence in the South while Lucy earned money as a tutor to wealthy plantation families. In 1826 he sailed with his partly finished collection to England. \"The American Woodsman\" was literally an overnight success. His life-size, highly dramatic bird portraits, along with his embellished descriptions of wilderness life, hit just the right note at the height of the Continent’s Romantic era. Audubon found a printer for the Birds of America, first in Edinburgh, then London, and later collaborated with the Scottish ornithologist William MacGillivray on the Ornithological Biographies – life histories of each of the species in the work. \r\n\r\nThe last print was issued in 1838, by which time Audubon had achieved fame and a modest degree of comfort, traveled this country several more times in search of birds, and settled in New York City. He made one more trip out West in 1843, the basis for his final work of mammals, the Viviparous Quadrupeds of North America, which was largely completed by his sons and the text of which was written by his long-time friend, the Lutheran pastor John Bachman (whose daughters married Audubon’s sons). Audubon spent his last years in senility and died at age 65. He is buried in the Trinity Cemetery at 155th Street and Broadway in New York City. \r\n\r\nAudubon’s story is one of triumph over adversity; his accomplishment is destined for the ages. He encapsulates the spirit of young America, when the wilderness was limitless and beguiling. He was a person of legendary strength and endurance as well as a keen observer of birds and nature. Like his peers, he was an avid hunter, and he also had a deep appreciation and concern for conservation; in his later writings he sounded the alarm about destruction of birds and habitats. It is fitting that today we carry his name and legacy into the future. \r\n(Audubon Society)",

"Biography":"American photographer. He studied philosophy at Columbia University, New York (1941–2), and from 1942 to 1944 served in the photography department of the US Merchant Marine, taking identity photographs of servicemen. He then studied photography under Alexey Brodovitch at the New School for Social Research, New York, from 1944 to 1950; from 1945 to 1965 he worked under Brodovitch and Carmel Snow for Harper’s Bazaar, contributing fashion photographs. As a young boy he had seen various fashion magazines and had been particularly impressed by the photographs of Martin Munkacsi. This influence remained in evidence in his own fashion work for Harper’s Bazaar, since he, too, photographed the models outside and in motion in order to arrive at dramatic, sometimes blurred, images. From 1950 he also contributed photographs to Life, Look and Graphis and in 1952 became Staff Editor and photographer for Theatre Arts. Towards the end of the 1950s he became dissatisfied with daylight photography and open air locations and so turned to studio photography, using strobe lighting. In 1965 he left Harper’s Bazaar to work for Vogue under Diana Vreeland and Alexander Liberman. Avedon presented fashion photography as theatre, and his innovative style greatly influenced other photographers; his work of the 1960s hinted at the energy and sexual explicitness of the period.\r\n\r\nConcurrent with his commercial assignments, Avedon produced portrait photographs of both celebrities and ordinary Americans. In his book Nothing Personal (1964), which includes portraits of figures such as the philosopher Bertrand Russell together with images of prisoners, the mentally ill and the poor, he created a disturbingly contrasting picture of society. In 1976 he photographed American businessmen and political leaders for a portfolio in Rolling Stone. His portraits, made with a view camera and often printed larger than life, are stark images with plain white backdrops, with the sitter generally looking directly at the camera. The unflinching quality of such works is especially evident in a series of portraits of his dying father exhibited in 1974 at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. He adapted this style for In the American West, a series of portraits produced from 1979 to 1984 for the Amon Carter Museum in Fort Worth, TX. The harsh realism of these portraits of miners, oil workers and slaughter house workers provides a powerful, if bleak, record of working life in the region. A major retrospective exhibition of Avedon’s photographs was mounted in 1994 at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York (GDA).",

"Biography":"American, b. 1925\r\n\r\nOscar Bailey earned a B.A. in art from Wilmington College in Ohio in 1951 and shortly thereafter went to work for a commercial printer in Delaware, Ohio. When the shop obtained a copy camera, Bailey asked to work with it. His interest in photography grew, and soon he bought his own camera - the best he could get for a full week's pay. Bailey taught himself how to use a camera, and after three or four years, he decided to make photography his career. He enrolled in the MFA program at Ohio University, graduating in 1958 with a degree in photography. Bailey was professor of photography at State University College in Buffalo, New York, from 1958 until 1969 and left to start the photography program at the University of South Florida, where he was a professor until he retired in 1985. Bailey came to U.S.F. when the first phase of Graphicstudio was just beginning, and he became an active participant in the program, ontributing his photographic expertise to a number of projects, including those of James Rosenquist and Robert Rauchenberg. Bailey was selected by Minor White for inclusion in two issues of the important magazine Aperture in 1959 and 1961.\r\n\r\nIn 1962 Bailey became a founding member of the Society for Photographic Education. In addition to his tenure at U.S.F., his teaching activities have included visiting artist appointments at the Penland School of Crafts in North Carolina (1971, 1973, 1979) as well as artist-in-residence at ArtPark in Lewiston, New York (1977). In 1972 Bailey supervised the publication of the book, Silver Bullets, a collection of photographs by U.S.F. art students.\r\n\r\nOne-man exibitions of his work have been organized by Indiana University (1960), Kalamazoo Institute of Arts, Michigan (1963), Ohio Wesleyan University (1964), International Museum of Photography, George Eastman House, Rochester, New York (1964), University of Oregon, Eugene (1969), University of South Florida, Tampa (1972, 1974), University of Colorado, Boulder (1976), Southern Illinois University, Carbondale (1977), University of North Florida, Jacksonville (1978) and the Lynch Gallery, St. Petersburg, Florida (1981).\r\n\r\nAbove taken from http:\/\/www.josephbellows.com\/artists\/oscar_bailey\/bio\/",

"Biography":"American conceptual artist. After studying art at San Diego State College (1949–57), he began to develop his painting style, soon incorporating letters, words and photographs in his works. By 1966 he was using photographs and text, or simply text, on canvas as in Semi-close-up of Girl by Geranium … (1966–8; Basle, Kstmus.). From 1970 he worked in printmaking, film, video, installation, sculpture and photography. His work is characterized by a consciousness of language evident in his use of puns, semantics based on the structuralism of Claude Lévi-Strauss and by the incorporation of material drawn from popular culture. Both are apparent in Blasted Allegories (1978; New York, Sonnabend Gal.), a series combining polaroids of television images captioned and arranged to suggest an unusual syntax. Baldessari differed from other conceptual artists in his humour and commitment to the visual image. He dramatized the ordinary, although beneath the apparent simplicity of his words and images lie multiple connotations (GDA).",

"Biography":"At its core, Jerrold Ballaine’s recent work is about contradictions.  At once, it denotes motion and stasis, engagement and neutrality, impermanence and monumentality, beauty and rawness.  It is also contradictory in its use of materials.\r\n \r\nThe artist has long painted like a sculptor; he now sculpts like a painter.  For Ballaine, such dichotomies parallel and define his career, which has evolved over fifty years from a Bay Area figurative artist, to a sculptor of vacuum-formed plastics, to a landscapist, to a figure painter, and now to a stone sculptor.  Throughout these diverse styles, his aim has been to evolve naturally and steadily and never to become pigeonholed by a particular style, following artistic paths even when they might not be commercially viable.  There is, however, one constant that runs throughout Ballaine’s work—he has never relinquished his adherence to representational subject matter or the technical side of creation.  “I’m old fashioned,” the artist admits.  “I am an object maker.”   \r\n\r\nIn Ballaine’s hands, two- and three-dimensional media have more commonalities than differences.  Even in his earliest paintings, Ballaine sculpted.  Having studied under Richard Diebenkorn at the San Francisco Art Institute in 1960-61, an artist and teacher that Ballaine acknowledges as his most profound artistic influence, he started out as a Bay Area Figurative painter.  He came to the San Francisco Bay Area after studying business at the University of Washington and serving in the military in Germany for two years.  He then attended the Art Center School in Los Angeles.  At the San Francisco Art Institute, he began to paint representational works with the vivid palette and loaded brush of an Abstract Expressionist.  These early paintings, which depicted landscape and\/or the human figure, were composed of such thickly layered, luscious paint that they literally became sculptural reliefs.  Coming as close to pure abstraction as Ballaine ever cared to get, the canvases were slathered with pigment acquired from Bay City Paint, whose exceptionally reasonable prices induced a veritable “school” of San Francisco artists to embrace thick, viscous paint application.  “Everyone was using Bay City Paint,” Ballaine remembers, including Jay DeFeo, Jim Weeks, and Ballaine’s one-time studio-mate, Joan Brown.  Even today, Ballaine admits to being “in love” with brushwork, although his acrylic canvases are now considerably smoother than were these early oils.   \r\n\r\n Since the early 1970s, Ballaine has used acrylic.  Although Ballaine now applies paint more smoothly than in his early oils, he still models his figures as would a sculptor, carving and defining their forms in space.  For the artist, these figurative paintings represent his coming full circle, hearkening back to his early influences and inspirations as a student at the Art Institute.  The figures in his canvases writhe and twist, pushing beyond the very limits of their humanity to become essays in movement and pure form.  To be sure, the figures are rendered expressionistically, but the artist is quick to point out that he is more interested in motion and positions than psychology or sexuality.  He sees these paintings as having more in common with the aims of artists such as the Italian Futurists than the distorted and violent emotional expressionism of an artist such as the British artist Francis Bacon.  The emotional intensity of Ballaine’s paintings stems not then from psychological engagement, but from brushwork and the organic, fluid qualities of the human form.  He intentionally obscures faces and genitals, areas of the body that best communicate psychology and menace in order to focus attention on more neutral states of the figure in arrested motion. \r\n\r\n It is also intentional that Ballaine’s forms assume poses not always possible in reality.  In creating his paintings, he starts with a model, first taking photographs of the sitter and then making drawings from the photos.  His paintings are then created from the drawings.  Each incarnation is a step away from his original source and results in imagery that is increasingly removed from reality.  What are left are raw abstractions of humans that are so fluid and nebulous that they seem almost devoid of skeletal systems.  In many cases, Ballaine uses no tangible source for his work, relying completely on memory, further enhancing the dreamlike quality of his work. \r\n\r\n The environments that Ballaine’s abstract figures inhabit are nearly as expressive as the figures themselves and are rich in variety.  Soft-edged fields of color float hazily in atmospheric layers.  Medium-width bands appear abraded, dragged, and scrubbed, and dark lines are sharp and distinct, defining corners and the edges of walls.  So carefully composed and energized are these backgrounds that they could in fact function as completed paintings in themselves, even without the figures.  As such, they would belie Diebenkorn’s enduring influence, particularly his Ocean Park landscapes, for not only do Ballaine’s backgrounds ground the figures in an interior space, they in fact seem equally derived from the California landscape.  Since early in his career, Ballaine has found in Diebenkorn’s compositions a logic that appeals to his intellect.  He seems to have picked up his instructor’s methods “almost instinctively.”   \r\n\r\n At the same time that Ballaine produced his most recent series of paintings, he also began to capture the human figure in stone.  Although he has been making sculpture—in both plastic and clay—since the 1960s, Ballaine turned to marble only recently.  He was initially inspired to try his hand at stone carving because of an extended trip to Egypt in 1995.  It was not, however, until the summer of 2004, when he went to work with his friend and fellow sculptor Manuel Neri in Carrera, Italy, that he began to pursue this new path.  What resulted was a series of sculptures that share a strong relationship with the paintings, although with greater permanence.  Overtly contemporary in their abstract representation of the human form, the figures still manage to communicate some of the timelessness, strength, and mystery present in representations of ancient pharaohs.  While Ballaine’s sculptures do not share the heroicizing stasis of Egyptian prototypes, they do capture their monumentality and grandeur.   \r\n\r\n Like the figures in his paintings, the bodies in Ballaine’s sculptures, which are almost all female, seem to be caught between poses.  They are organic, twisting and turning, and ultimately captured for eternity in the act of gesture.  In their subtlety they may seem far removed from the brightly colored paintings, yet in both, forms emerge and dissolve, becoming sharp and then indistinct.  Akin to the paintings, the sculptures’ faces, limbs, and sexual anatomy are either obscured or removed altogether, and the human form offers only a superficial adherence to human anatomy.  Psychology, emotion, and personality become secondary to an abstracted human shell.\r\n\r\n In these sculptures, as in much of his other work, the artist is seduced by his materials.  He uses a variety of types of stone, some ordered from abroad and others quarried in California.  “Terrified” of pure white marble, Ballaine most often uses heavily veined stone, exploiting the natural irregularities to dictate the basis for the figure that lies within.  For him, the stone is like a “fabric” that dresses his figures.  In some instances, he enhances the natural colors of the stone with permanent stains.  These blend seamlessly with the existing veins to blur where Ballaine leaves off and nature begins.  Staining also helps the artist to articulate and define his forms in much the same way that he “sculpts” them on canvas.  In finishing the figures, he is careful not to over polish them, which he feels might take away from their seriousness of purpose and make them too “decorative.” \r\n\r\n Here too, however, the artist exploits contradiction.  The gravity of the work and the hardness of the stone compete with the subtle beauty and seduction of sugar-like marble and soft, sensuous veining that begs to be caressed.  As in the paintings, the beauty of the objects themselves lures the viewer in and then the apparent disregard for the sanctity of the human form, as well as the figures’ emotional detachment, is more directly confrontational and challenging.  What results is the seductive, repellant, and captivating push and pull of engagement.\r\n\r\nScott A. Shields, Ph.D.\r\nChief Curator\r\nCrocker Art Museum, Sacramento",

He has taught workshops since 1972.\r\n\r\nBruce's educational background includes Bachelor's and Master's degrees in mathematics from UCLA in 1965 and 1967. After working for several years as a mathematical analyst and computer programmer for missile guidance systems, he abruptly left the field and turned to photography in late 1970.\r\n\r\nHis classic book in four movements, Visual Symphony, was published in 1986 by Alfred van der Marck Editions. A second edition was published in 1988, along with a German Language version of the book, published by Edition Braus. The book is now sold out and out of print.\r\n\r\nThe Art of Photography, An Approach to Personal Expression, first published in 1994 by Kendall\/Hunt Publisher (with a revised, expanded edition published in 1999), is a complete illustrated textbook on photography, delving into its technical, aesthetic, philosophical, and creative aspects. A fourth edition—expanded and updated—was published in December, 2007, and is updated on a regular basis.\r\n\r\nTone Poems -- Book 1, which combines photography with music in a uniquely insighful collaboration with Pianist Judith Cohen, was published in 2002 by Photographic Arts Editions.\r\n\r\nTone Poems ~ Book 2, the extraordinary second book of the planned four-part collaborative series, was published in 2005.\r\n\r\nBruce is a frequent contributor to several photography magazines: his feature article, The Master Printing Class, appears in each issue of Photo Techniques, and he has been published regularly in LensWork, with articles, interviews, his “1998 Portfolio,” his photogravures of 5 images from his studies of the Cathedrals of England, and his \"Slit Canyon\" portfolio. Through his workshops, articles, lectures, textbook, and his innovative photogaphy\/music collaboration Bruce is a well respected photographer, educator, and pioneer.\r\n\r\nBruce is also recognized as one of the finest darkroom printers on this planet, both through his exceptional b&w work, and also through his color imagery. His work is represented by more than ten galleries throughout the United States and Canada, and is in the collections of museums and private collectors worldwide.\r\n\r\nHis photography expands upon the dynamics he finds in both nature and the works of man, relating forces to the sweeping forms that dominate his vivid imagery. Visually he emphasizes the best of humanity and nature, sometimes with bold realism, often with degrees of abstraction to heighten the mystery. He understands light to an extent rarely found, and combines this understanding with a mastery of composition, applying them to an extraordinarily wide range of subject matter. His photographs often contain ambiguities concerning either the size of the scene photographed and\/or its orientation, forcing the viewer to pause and think, and to become part of the creative process.\r\n\r\nBruce has been an active environmental advocate for more than three decades, both independently and through organizations such as the Sierra Club (where he served on the Board of Directors of the Angeles Chapter from 1976-80, and the California Regional Conservation Committee), Audubon, the Stillaguamish Citizens' Alliance (which he co-founded in 1991), 1000 Friends of Washington, and the North Cascades Conservation Council (where he has served on the Board of Directors since 1994). As a photographer he has seen the changes—almost all of them for the worse—that have taken place in the 35 years he has actively been photographing our planet. He points out that we all live on this one magical globe called \"Earth,\" and unless we love it, revere it, and protect it, we'll all perish with it. Currently, we are expoiting planet earth at an unprecedented rate, saddling ourselves with many self-inflicted problems: human overpopulation, global warming, an increasing ozone hole, deforestation, overfishing of the oceans, overuse of fresh water resources, pollution of the air, land, and waters (lakes, rivers, and oceans), and many others too numerous to detail. But humanity is doing little to correct any one of these problems. We have enough knowledge to recognize the steps that should be taken to turn from our destructive ways to more intelligent, productive, and sustainable means, but we may not have the wisdom or political will to implement that knowledge. \r\n\r\nTaken from http:\/\/www.barnbaum.com\/",

"Biography":"Painter and muralist Gifford Beal was born in New York City in 1879, the youngest of six children. Beal began his art training at 13, when he accompanied his older brother, Reynolds Beal, to the Shinnecock School of Art for classes with William Merritt Chase. Gifford Beal continued to study with Chase for ten years at Shinnecock, the Tenth Street Studio building in New York City, and the New York School of Art. Beal attended college at Princeton University from 1896 to 1900, and from 1901 to 1903 he also took classes at the Art Students League with George Bridgman and Frank Vincent DuMond. In 1908, Beal married Maud Ramsdell of Newburgh, New York, where the Beal family also had an estate. They had two sons, William (b. 1914) and Gifford, Jr. (b. 1917). READ MORE\r\n\r\nBeal received all of his training in the United States at a time when European art training was the norm among his peers. Beal's earliest subject matter was taken from the familiar worlds of New York City and the Hudson River Valley, where he frequently spent his summers. Later work would depict other summer homes, including Provincetown, Rockport, and Gloucester, Massachusetts. Throughout his career he explored a variety of styles in his approach to these and other representational subjects such as garden parties, the circus, Central Park scenes, and coastal scenes in the Northeast and the Caribbean. \r\n\r\nBeal exhibited at the National Academy of Design's annual exhibition almost continuously from 1901 to 1956, was a member of the Academy from 1914, and won at least seven awards given by the Academy over the course of his career. He won his first award in 1903 from the Worcester Art Museum. He exhibited regularly in major annual exhibitions and world expositions, including the Panama Pacific Exposition of 1915, where he won a gold medal. \r\n\r\nGifford and Reynolds Beal exhibited in a two-man show in 1907 at Clausen Galleries, and the two brothers were both eventually represented by Kraushaar Galleries, where Gifford Beal had his first one-man show in 1920. Beal served as president of the Art Students League from 1916 until 1930, the longest term of any president, and taught there in 1931 and 1932. \r\n\r\nBeal was commissioned by the Section on Painting and Sculpture of the Works Progress Administration to paint ten murals for the Allentown, Pennsylvania post office in the late 1930s. The Allentown murals depicted American revolutionaries hiding the liberty bell at Allentown. In 1941, he completed two murals in the Department of the Interior building in Washington, DC: North Country, and Tropical Country, and he painted seven panels at Princeton University in 1943 depicting the life of the nineteenth-century engineer Joseph Henry. He was awarded an honorary Masters degree by Princeton in 1947. \r\n\r\nRetrospective exhibitions were held at the Century Club, San Francisco Museum, Des Moines Art Center, and Butler Institute in the early 1950s. Upon his death in 1956, a memorial exhibition was held at the American Academy of Arts and Letters, where Beal became a member in 1943.\r\n\r\n",

"Biography":"Romare Bearden was born in North Carolina, but grew up in Harlem where his mother led the New York office of an African-American newspaper. As a result, Bearden became familiar with the artists of the Harlem Renaissance at an early age. To support himself, Bearden worked a full-time job in the New York Department of Social Services and, until the 1960s, had to limit his creative output to the evenings and weekends. Early in his career this included writing and songwriting, as well as the fine arts. He began as a painter and later developed an interest in interested in collage and printmaking. He strove to produce innovative work that concentrated on the African-American experience. In 1963, together with Norman Lewis, he founded the Spiral Group, an organization that produced works of art in response to the civil rights movement (ULAN).\r\n\r\nRomare Bearden is best known for his collages, which he began making in 1963, after several decades of painting in a linear and semi-abstract style.  As cofounder of Spiral, a group convened \"to examine the plight of the Black American artist\", Bearden created his first collages for Spiral's inaugural show by juxtaposing enlarged photographic  enlargements of magazine clippings with colored paper (often enhanced with graphite or paint) to convey human narratives of urban and rural African American life. As the writer Ralph Ellison put it, Bearden's collages convey the \"sharp breaks, leaps in consciousness, distortions, paradoxes, reversals, telescoping of time and Surreal blending of styles, values, hopes and dreams which characterize much of Negro American history\" (Laura Giles, Heather and Paul G. Haaga Jr., Class of 1970, Curator of Prints and Drawings)",

"Biography":"Considered by many to be the finest woman painter active in America at the turn of the century, Beaux was not only technically masterful in her rich, vigorous manipulation of paint and her subtle orchestration of color, but also as a keen observer and an innovative designer. By 1902 Beaux was recognized as one of the top portrait painters in America. She had exhibited her work and garnered prizes in museum exhibitions from Philadelphia to New York to Paris.1 She was awarded full membership in the male-dominated National Academy. And perhaps just as telling of her popularity, she painted a portrait of Mrs. Theodore Roosevelt and her daughter in the White House, Mrs. Theodore Roosevelt and Daughter Ethel (1901-02, private collection).\r\nBeaux was born in Philadelphia. Due to her mother's early death and her French father's subsequent departure to Europe, she was raised by her maternal grandmother and aunt. The example of her aunt, the artist Eliza Lewitt, was a very positive one for her. With her family's support and her aunt's inspiration, Beaux set out to be a painter. At the age of sixteen she studied drawing under Catherine Drinker, an historical and religious painter whose brother later married Beaux's sister. In 1872 or 1873, she took instruction from Adolf Van der Whalen, a Dutch artist active in Philadelphia. She also appears to have taken classes at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts between 1877 and 1879 under Thomas Eakins. Additionally, between 1881 and 1883, Beaux studied semi-privately in a friend's studio with William Sartain. Between 1888 and 1889, Beaux traveled to Europe where she studied at the Acad6mie Julian and the Colarrosi Academie under Bouguereau, Fleury, Dagnan-Bouveret, and Courtois, as well as privately with Benjamin Constant. In 1895, she became the first full-time woman faculty member at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, where she would teach drawing, painting, and portraiture for the next twenty years.\r\nhttp:\/\/www.butlerart.com\/pc_book\/pages\/cecilia_beaux_1855.htm",

Benton moved to New York City ca. 1912 where he began exhibiting his works (then reminiscent of Synchromism), and fell under the influence of Marxism. In the early 1920s, his work began exploring American narrative themes utilizing highly stylized figurations and backgrounds. By the 30s, Benton was considered a Regionalist, and had been commissioned to paint the first of many murals, which spawned controversy because of their politics. Benton left New York City in 1935 and continued to paint socially conscious murals until the 1960s. American artist, born Mo (ULAN).",

In 1850, Black met photographer John Adams Whipple and the two men formed a partnership called Whipple & Black in Boston. The collaboration lasted from 1856 to 1859. In 1860, Black took the first aerial photographs of Boston. In the same year, he also formed a partnership with another photographer named Case, beginning a collaboration that lasted until the 1870s. The two men introduced porcelain photographs during this time. In 1872, Black photographed the Boston fire (ULAN).",

"Biography":"Gutzon Borglum was born on March 25, 1867, in the Idaho Territory, the son of Danish immigrants. Restless and independent, he left home as a youth and made his way to San Francisco, where he enrolled at the Mark Hopkins Art Institute. His first formal training was under William Keith. Dissatisfied with painting, Borglum traveled to Paris in 1887 and studied sculpture at the Académie Julian; he also came under the influence of the French sculptor Auguste Rodin. After touring Spain and England, Borglum returned to the United States in 1901 and opened a studio in New York. In 1904 he won a gold medal at the St. Louis Exposition for his vigorous and powerfully modeled work Mares of Diomedes.\r\n\r\nIn the next few years Borglum executed a series of 12 Apostles for the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, New York City. In 1908 the Library of Congress accepted his 6-ton marble head of Lincoln. A group of Southern women commissioned an enormous image of Gen. Robert E. Lee for the face of Stone Mountain, Ga., in 1916. While the women planned a solitary figure, the sculptor envisioned additional figures covering the entire length of the dome-shaped mountain. Dissension soon overtook the project, and unexpected expenses combined with personality conflicts led to a court fight. In a fit of rage Borglum destroyed his models, and the state of Georgia filed suit. Borglum won, but in 1925 he was dismissed from the Stone Mountain project (it was not finished until the spring of 1970).\r\n\r\nBorglum's dream of carving gigantic figures in \"live\" mountain rock was realized, when he was commissioned to carve a national monument at Mt. Rushmore, S. Dak., in 1925 and began the work two years later. Impressed with the \"bigness\" of America, he believed that American art must also be gigantic. He chose to carve Washington, Lincoln, Jefferson, and Theodore Roosevelt because he believed that they represented the spirit and ideals of American geographic expansion and political development. On July 4, 1930, the head of George Washington was unveiled. Jefferson was completed in 1936, Lincoln in 1937, and Theodore Roosevelt in 1939.\r\n\r\nThe work, supervised by Borglum and his engineer, was carried out by a crew of local workmen. Each head was carved with dynamite and jackhammers. Financial problems caused frequent interruptions. Early in March 1941 Borglum left the work for a minor operation in Chicago, where he suffered a heart attack and died on March 6. His son finished his father's masterpiece. The entire project cost approximately $1, 520, 000 and took 16 years from inception to completion.\r\n\r\nBorglum was a popular sculptor who never lacked commissions. Among his many works are an equestrian portrait of Gen. Philip Sheridan, three full-length figures for the U.S. Capitol, a statue of William Jennings Bryan, Seated Lincoln, and Wars of America.\r\n\r\nHis ability to execute sculpture on a grand scale qualifies Borglum as a skilled engineer as well as a talented artist. Modern critics and Borglum's contemporaries agree that his sculpture is good work but not great art. His major contribution to art was the expert technical knowledge which he displayed in handling monumental sculpture.\r\n\r\nFurther Reading\r\n\r\nFor a complete story of Borglum's greatest sculptural achievement consult Gilbert C. Fite, Mount Rushmore (1952). A personal portrait of Borglum, written by a friend, is Robert J. Dean, Living Granite: The Story of Borglum and the Mount Rushmore Memorial (1949). J. Walker McSpadden, Famous Sculptors of America (1924), devotes a chapter to Borglum's life and work. Written during Borglum's lifetime, it contains more information on the sculptor's early period than on later works. For a more recent but similar sketch see Wayne Craven, Sculpture in America (1968). \r\n\r\n",

"Biography":"Best known for large figural works, portraits, and still lifes in realist style with interplay of design elements, Robert Brackman created paintings that show the gamut of technical and imaginative skills. From 1931, he had a long career teaching at the Art Students League in New York and was a life member of the League. He also taught at the American Art School in New York City, the Brooklyn Museum School, the Lyme Art Academy, and the Madison Art School in Connecticut.\r\n\r\nAs a portraitist, he painted notables including John D Rockefeller, Jr., Charles Lindburgh, and John Foster Dulles as well as portraits commissioned by the Air Force Academy and the State Department. He was so successful with his portrait painting that he had to choose amongst persons wanting to commission him and from 1940, limited his sitters to three or four a year.\r\n\r\nHe was born in Odessa, Russia, and came to the United States in 1908. He studied at The National Academy of Design from 1919 to 1921, and the Ferrer School in San Francisco. In New York, he also studied with Robert Henri and George Bellows at the National Academy of Design.\r\n\r\nFrom 1934 to 1944, he had seven one-man exhibitions in New York City at Macbeth Gallery.\r\n\r\n",

"Biography":"New York photographic and installation artist Adam Baer creates aperture-specific constructions which visually fuse disparate elements of atmosphere, sections of architecture and fragments of narrative. The work uses the physics of spatial relationships between people and objects in concert with the viewer’s learned experience of ocular perception as a means of both constructing and deconstructing extraordinary photographic spaces through complex tableaux narratives. The work explores the vast disconnect between what is experienced in two dimensional representation and three dimensional reality.\r\n\r\n\r\nBaer's creative process begins with the construction of a large, intricate, labor and time-intensive set that takes many months to complete. Actors are then cast to inhabit the set and play parts in an ambiguous drama. The scene is finally photographed with a large format view camera at which point an illusion of convergence of the various atmospheres occurs. Baer's work results in large color photographs of bafflingly strange spaces in which laws of gravity are defied, architectural spaces confused, and our experiences of the physical world refuted. Visual cues that normally help us make sense of our surroundings and of art such as scale, depth, consistent light sources and angle of plane are distorted to produce a deliberately dream-like result. Although Baer's images exhibit a distinctly surreal look, each print originates from a single negative exposed only once.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus, the photograph's oddity derives not from digital manipulation but from the peculiar combination of set design, the swings and tilts characteristic of the view camera, and the particular choice of aperture. Amongst a sea of digitally altered images, Baer's creations are a testament to previsualization, progressive invention, and pure photography.\r\n\r\nAdam Baer received his BFA in photography from SUNY Purchase in 1992, and is currently working in Brooklyn.

In 1843 Southworth joined Josiah Johnson Hawes in partnership in a Boston daguerreotype studio. In 1846 Southworth photographed the solar eclipse and also took pictures of the moon. Southworth invented a camera for multiple images in 1846-1847. In 1849 he left the partnership with Hawes and travelled to California to seek gold. While in the West he photographed San Francisco, California. In 1851 Southworth became ill and returned to Boston. In 1851 Southworth renewed the partnership with Hawes. In 1856-1857 Southworth conceived the idea of identifying people by means of photography applied to graphology. Auer states that the partnership between Southworth and Hawes was dissolved in 1861-1862, and both became independent photographers in the Boston area; Johnson gives date of dissolution as 1861 (ULAN).",

"Biography":"In 1858 Jackson began working as a retoucher and colorist at the portrait studio of C.C. Schoonmaker in Troy, New York. In 1867 Jackson set up a studio in Omaha, Nebraska with his brother Edward. The studio specialized in portraits and photographs of Amerindian villages. In 1869, Jackson travelled with A.C. Hull and photographed along the Union Pacific Railroad. From 1870 to 1877 Jackson was a photographer for the U.S. Geological Survey of the Territories, commissioned by Professor Ferdinand Hayden. Jackson closed his Omaha studio at this time. Jackson photographed Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming and Idaho in 1871 and travelled to New Mexico in 1877 to photograph the native American villages. In 1879, Jackson founded the Jackson Photo Company in Denver, Colorado, where he sold pictures of his journey across the United States. He also produced Indian portraits and printed those by other photographers, for the American Bureau of Ethnology. In 1881, the firm Jackson Photographic Co. became Jackson & Rinehart, and then W.H. Jackson Photograph and Publishing Co. in 1883-1884. Jackson was hired by the architect Daniel Burnham to photograph the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893. In 1894 Jackson travelled with the World's Transportation Commission to the Near and Far East, Australia, China, Siberia, and Russia. In 1897 Jackson acquired part interest in the Detroit Publishing Co. which printed and distributed his photographs. The Detroit Publishing Co. went bankrupt in 1924 and Jackson moved to Washington D.C. where he began to paint. In 1929 Jackson moved to New York City, New York.  (ULAN)",

In 1848 he entered into a partnership with his brother-in-law in Philadelphia; the pair operated a daguerreian studio for two years, until Bell began to work on his own, at times still collaborating with others. A veteran of the Mexican War, Bell joined the Union Army and, after fighting in the battles of Antietam and Gettysburg during the American Civil War, he was appointed chief photographer of the Army Medical Museum in Washington, D.C. He set up a studio in Philadelphia, and in 1872 Lieutenant George Wheeler, engineer of the fourth United States Geological Survey, commissioned Bell to accompany him as photographer on an expedition in Arizona. His field experience led to later jobs as photographer for the Pennsylvania railroad and with an expedition to Patagonia (ULAN).",

"Biography":"In 1995, with the unexpected help of an NEA rejection, Merry Alpern became notorious for her photo series \"Dirty Windows.\" Even if they couldn't resist looking, viewers were made uneasy by these voyeuristic images, secretly taken through the bathroom window of a low-rent sex club near Wall Street. For the series, Alpern hid out in a building across an air shaft, capturing blow jobs, strip teases, coke-snorting, and a host of other activities with a telephoto lens. Now she's come out in the open, sort of, to document another form of commerce: women rifling through clothing racks, trying on bathing suits, handing over the plastic - that is, shopping. But the brisk, businesslike missions of these women aren't so far removed from the single-minded, sensual pursuits of the male figures in \"Dirty Windows.\" After all, if men purchase sex, at best, to relieve stress or to escape from ordinary life, it could be argued that many women shop for the same reasons.\r\n\r\nWith a tiny surveillance camera and a video camcorder hidden in her discreetly perforated purse, Alpern wandered through department stores, malls, and fitting rooms. Whereas each scene in the earlier series was framed by the same set of windows, the photos in \"Shopping\" (all 1999), painstakingly culled from hours of accumulated footage, are in a sense arbitrary and unmoored - even the camera was detached from the photographer's eye.\r\n\r\nIn one photo, a pink buckled shoe hovers like some fabulous spacecraft over the rest of the fleet, black pumps and sling-backs lined up on clean white shelves; only the fingers glimpsed at the edge of the frame suggest that Alpern herself was holding the shoe. Other images are equally off-kilter, capitalizing on the trope of making the familiar strange through gross distortions or compositions that verge on the abstract. One picture is all swooping curves of beige-toned walls, accented with a few bright blobs of fluorescent lights, with only a man's head barely visible above a heavy black diagonal line to indicate that this is a view of an escalator.\r\n\r\nWith their harsh lighting and muddy, slightly pixelated texture, these images feel woozy, aimless, all out of sorts - the expression of an aesthetic not unlike the feeling of mall burnout. Fragmented by mirrors, many of the works intensify the dazzling yet disorienting effect that merchandisers are after in using so many reflective surfaces. In some shots women scrutinize themselves with looks that are variously pained or pleased. One squeezes her dimpled thighs; another, in kneesocks and a bikini, seems to be not so much appraising the swimsuit as contemplating her very existence.\r\n\r\nWhile in both technique and aesthetic \"Shopping\" is distanced, Alpern's approach is also participatory, acknowledging her own browsing habit and capturing numerous self-portraits in the process. This brings a lacerating, insider quality to images that might otherwise be seen as a more typical sociological or ironic critique of rampant consumerism. Secretly documenting women's endless search for the perfect, purchasable item, Alpern implies a flight from a lot of other things.\r\n\r\nAbove taken from http:\/\/rogallery.com\/Alpern_Merry\/alpern-biography.html",

"Biography":"Washington Allston was an important American exponent of the intense Romanticism of the early 19th century; he may be credited with taking American painting from a generally narrow interest in fact into a more imaginative realm. Allston's paintings are noted for their brilliant sunlight and strikingly transparent color achieved with a Venetian method of glazing he learnt while studying in London. Early works include some noteworthy portraits (e.g. Self-Portrait, 1805, and Portrait of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, 1806) and historic landscapes, with \"Diana and her Nymphs in the Chase\" (1805) being his first critical success. Biblical themes next captured his interest; \"Dead Man Restored to Life by Touching the Bones of the Prophet Elisha\" (1811-1814) is indicative of his unique choices of subject matter, of his dramatic and mysterious Romantic style, and of the contemporary interest in bolstering religious faith by historical analogy. His later works were more lyrical; the peaceful and poetic \"Moonlit Landscape\" of 1819 is in essence about the human spirit expanding in the spacious quiet of nature. These later paintings mark him as a forerunner of the visionary and subjective trend in landscape painting in America. Allston's writings include poetry, a Gothic novel entitled \"Monaldi\" (1841), and his \"Lectures of Art,\" posthumously published in 1850 (ULAN).\r\n\r\nActive in Boston, MA",

"Biography":"One of the most important contemporary artists working today, Glenn Ligon first came to prominence in the late 1980s, during the heyday of so-called \"identity politics art.\" Four Untitled Etchings is related formally, thematically, and historically to the work for which he is best-known: oil-stick and coal dust \"paintings\" from the early to mid 1990s. In 2011, on the eve of his first comprehensive retrospective, Ligon now boasts a broad body of work in a variety of media, from film and video to photography, prints, and paintings. Alternately rigorous, poignant, funny, and sensuous, his oeuvre is unified around a strategy as well as a set of problems. Quotation is central to Ligon's project: almost with fail, his work proceeds by appropriating and repurposing traditions (self-portraiture, monochromatic abstraction, language-based conceptual art, critical postmodernism) and source material (African-American literature, 19th-century slave narratives, the civil rights movement, Robert Mapplethorpe's photographs, Richard Pryor's inflammatory jokes, Afro-centric coloring books). Race, homosexuality, prejudice, stereotypes, and the taxed negotiation of identity constitute Ligon's primary subject matter.\r\n\r\nLigon received a BA from Wesleyan University in 1982. In 1985, he attended the Whitney Museum Independent Study Program. Ligon's work has been featured in dozens of solo and group exhibitions in cities such as New York, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Toronto, Paris, Minneapolis, Washington, DC, Mexico City, and Kassel, and it can be found in the collections of MoMA, the Carnegie, Harvard, Albright-Knox, the Hirschhorn, the Guggenheim, SF MoMA, the Tate, and the PMA, among others. For its part, Four Untitled Etchings was considered important enough to be featured in Ligon's 2005 retrospective at the Power Plant, and editions are owned by at least three other museums, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the National Gallery, and the Davison, at Wesleyan.",

"Biography":"Esteban Vicente was born in 1903 in Turégano (Segovia). In 1921 he enrolled in the Escuela de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in Madrid with the intention of becoming a sculptor, but he soon decided to devote himself to painting.\r\n\r\nHis Madrid period is marked by his contact and friendship with writers and artists such as García Lorca, Juan Ramón Jiménez, Alberti, Luis Buñuel, Juan Bonafé, Bores and the Pole Wadislaw Jahl. His esthetic proposals mark him as a member of the group later classified as the \"painter-poets\", in that their work was the artistic counterpart of the group of poets known as the Generation of 1927. In fact, he published his first drawings in two literary reviews: Verso y Prosa and Mediodía. \r\n\r\nn 1929 he moved to Paris where he met, among others, Picasso, Dufy and Max Ernst. He then spent a year in Barcelona, where he had several exhibitions. His painting at that time took on the tone of a light and dreamy sketch, with a melancholy, pale coloring. Nevertheless, it already showed traces of the structural rigor and deliberate lack of emphasis that would characterize his entire oeuvre.\r\n\r\nIn 1936 he travelled to New York, and after a brief period of activity in the service of the Spanish Republic, he entered fully into the artistic life of the metropolis. In 1940 he became an American citizen and then began a period of creative crisis that would lead to his encounter with Abstract Expressionism. In his dialogue with it over a period of two decades, Esteban Vicente gradually consolidated his own uniquely personal style, based on vibrant chromatic harmonies on top of vaguely geometric structures, sometimes evocative of inner landscapes. The exploration of these channels brought him the friendship of members of the New York School: Rothko, De Kooning, Pollock, Kline and Newman, in addition to the critics, Harold Rosenberg and Thomas B. Hess. \r\n\r\nHe was chosen to participate in the most significant exhibitions of the period, New Talents 1950 and 9th Street, which earned him a prominent place within the first generation of American Abstract Expressionism.\r\n\r\nThroughout his life Esteban Vicente devoted an important part of his career to teaching at the most prestigious institutions in the United States. In this regard, special mention should be made of his work at the legendary Black Mountain School alongside Merce Cunningham and John Cage, in addition to his collaboration with the New York Studio School of Drawing, Painting and Sculpture, of which he was a founding member. In addition, he received some of the most prestigious awards given to an artist in the United States, and his works can be found in important collections and museums such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Museum of Modern Art, The Whitney Museum of American Art, and The Guggenheim.\r\n\r\nShortly before his ninety-eighth birthday on 11 January 2001, Esteban Vicente died at his home in Bridgehampton (Long Island). In accordance with his wishes, his ashes rest in the garden of his Museo in Segovia. The work done in his last two years-he continued working until shortly before his death-was shown in the exhibition, Color is Light. Esteban Vicente 1999-2000, whose catalog contains his writing and thoughts on art.\r\n\r\nIn his last years he was given ample recognition by Spain, beginning in 1991 when His Majesty, King Juan Carlos, bestowed on him the Gold Medal of Fine Arts. In 1998 he was given the Fine Arts Award by the Junta de Castilla y León, and in the same year a large retrospective exhibition was held at the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía. Finally, this Museo was inaugurated in Segovia under the sponsorship of the Diputación Provincial, whose president is the Honorable Javier V. Santamaría Herranz. In 1999, Esteban Vicente was awarded the Great Cross of the Order of Alfonso X el Sabio and a permanent room devoted to his work was inaugurated in the Museo Reina Sofía. The aforementioned events, together with his participation in important exhibitions, have at last established the figure and work of Esteban Vicente within their proper place in twentieth-century Spanish culture.\r\n\r\nAbove biography taken from <http:\/\/www.museoestebanvicente.es\/eng\/biografia.asp>",

"Biography":"Helmut K. Wimmer, whose vivid depictions of twirling planets, glowing comets, pulsing nebulas and space-bending black holes awed thousands of visitors craning their necks under the dome of the old Hayden Planetarium for more than 30 years, died on March 20, 2006, near his home in Stuart, Fla. He was 80. \r\n\r\nOfficials at the planetarium and its parent institution, the American Museum of Natural History, said they had not been told of Mr. Wimmer's death until last week. News of his death was published only as paid death notices in papers in Florida. \r\n\r\nMr. Wimmer was the planetarium's staff artist from 1954 to 1987, primarily during its predigital days and before the 90-foot-high glass cube of the Rose Center for Earth and Space, with its new planetarium, opened in 2000. \r\n\r\nWorking in a basement studio with an airbrush, and sometimes adding pebbles for three-dimensional effects, Mr. Wimmer produced hundreds of paintings on cardboard sheets. His finely etched paintings were then transferred onto high-resolution slides. Inserted into as many as 200 projectors on the perimeter of the planetarium's 48-foot-high dome, or into the tentacled, insectlike Zeiss projector standing in the middle, Mr. Wimmer's images wove seamless panoramas of cosmic vistas. \r\n\r\nFor a Martian landscape, Mr. Wimmer ringed the lower edge of the dome, like a horizon, so the viewer seemed to be standing on the planet's surface. He glued rocks and sand to the cardboard, then drew shadows on the landscape, precisely indicating where the Sun's rays should be cast by the Zeiss projector. \r\n\r\n''Without his art,'' said Neil deGrasse Tyson, the director of the Hayden Planetarium and an astrophysicist with the museum, ''your planetarium experience would be limited to pointing out the stars of the night sky. His artwork allowed generations of visitors to transport themselves from Earth to the surface of a star, the lunar landscape, the vicinity of a black hole.'' \r\n\r\nDr. Tyson called Mr. Wimmer, who never went to college, ''a scientifically literate artist.'' \r\n\r\n''For whatever he would draw, he would read the latest research, take data from telescopes and space probes and capture it as accurately as possible,'' Dr. Tyson said. \r\n\r\nHelmut Karl Wimmer was born in Munich on Dec. 8, 1925. At 14, he was hired as an apprentice to a sculptor and model maker. Three years later, he was drafted into the German army. In the closing days of the war, Mr. Wimmer was captured by Czech partisans who turned him over to the Russians. In 1949, after four years as a laborer in a Russian lumber camp, he returned to Munich.\r\n",

"Biography":"Olin Levi Warner (April 9, 1844 - August 14, 1896), an American sculptor and artist, was noted for the striking bas relief portrait medallions and busts he created in the late 19th century.[1].\r\n\r\nWarner was born in Suffield, Connecticut. As a young man he worked as an artisan and a telegraph operator. In 1869 he had saved up enough money to move to Paris, where he studied sculpture at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts under Francois Jouffroy, and worked as an assistant for Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux.\r\n\r\nWhen the French Third Republic was proclaimed in 1870, he enlisted in the Foreign Legion, resuming his studies when the siege was over (May 1871). In 1872 he removed to New York and established a studio. He was one of the founders and a member of the Society of American Artists in 1877[2], and an associate of the National Academy of Design in 1888.\r\n\r\nA trip through the northwest territory led to a series of Indian-themed portrait medallions. He designed the souvenir half-dollar for the Columbian Exposition, held in Chicago in 1893.\r\n\r\nAfter meeting with little commercial success, however, he returned to live at his father’s farm in Vermont, where he also did work for manufacturers of silver and plated ware. Towards the end of his life his sculptures became known to a wider audience.\r\n\r\nHe died in 1896, after a cycling accident in New York's Central Park. In the 1970's Warner's heirs donated Olin Levi Warner's collection of personal papers to the Smithsonian Archives of American Art.\r\n\r\nWarner is credited for having brought the French Beaux Arts style to the United States, and popularizing the bas relief through numerous portraits in this style. Among his best known works are:\r\n\r\n\"May\" (1872) \r\n\"Edwin Forrest\" (medallion, 1876) \r\n\"Rutherford B. Hayes\" (bust, 1876) \r\n\"Twilight \" (1878) \r\n\"Dancing Nymph\" (1879) \r\n\"Gov. William A. Buckingham\" (statue, 1883) \r\n\"William Lloyd Garrison\" (statue, 1885) \r\n\"The Reverend William F. Morgan, D. D.\" (bust, 1887) \r\nFountain for Portland, Oregon (1888) \r\n\"Diana\" (1888) \r\nThe bronze doors at the Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.[3] He was commissioned to create two large doors, and one of them had been completed when he died. \r\nWarner’s great-grand uncle was the Revolutionary leader Seth Warner.\r\n\r\n\r\n[edit] Notes\r\n^ Tolles, Thayer. \"American Relief Sculpture\".

Soon afterwards he quit lab work and became a portrait photographer. In 1850 he invented the \"crystalotype\", a process for making paper prints from glass negatives. Whipple was partner with James Wallace Black (1825-1896) from 1856 to 1859 in Boston. Whipple remained at this studio alone until 1874 at which time he abandoned photography and became a publisher of religious books. Whipple had an interest in celestial photography and beginning in 1848 he made daguerreotypes and crystalotypes of the moon and sun, and in 1867 photographed the solar eclipse. Whipple not only manufactured chemicals for daguerreotypists, he made them himself. He also experimented with glass negatives, microphotography, vignetting and the use of artificial light (ULAN).",

"Biography":"On March 18th noted Bay Area photographer and educator, Don Worth, passed away at his home in Mill Valley-he was 84 years old. Although he received a Master of Music degree at the Manhattan School of Music and studied at the Juilliard School of Music, Worth is best known for his stunning photographs of tropical plants and his ethereal landscapes. His quiet understated imagery was not only his artistic signature, but also a reflection of the man himself. Worth was also an educator that influenced countless students. In 1993 he retired as Emeritus Professor of Art from SFSU where he taught photography for over thirty years. Worth was born in Hayes County, NE in 1924 and raised on a small farm in Iowa. His childhood experiences in a rural setting shaped his artistic sensibilities and sparked a life-long interest in horticulture. Although Worth began cultivating exotic plants before the age ten, his initial means of artistic expression was through music. He began his study of piano at he age of eight and in 1946 traveled to New York to study piano and composition. During his studies he encountered the paintings of Georgia O'Keefe and later the photography of Ansel Adams. He was amazed how their art revealed a structure, and an emotional impact, he pursued through music. He immediately purchased a camera and began his life-long pursuit of photography. In the mid 1950's he met Ansel Adams. Ansel was very impressed with Worth, his photographs and their shared interest in music. In 1956 Don was hired as Adams' full-time assistant and continued in that position until 1960. They maintained a close personal friendship until Adams' death in 1984. Worth eventually put aside his pursuit of a career in music and devoted all of his creative energies to photography and the cultivation of plants. For 46 years Worth cultivated his nearly half-acre botanical garden in Mill Valley-it served as both his personal retreat and the subject of hundreds of his photographs. During the six decades that Worth pursued his photography he attained an international reputation as an outstanding photographer and master printer. In 1974 he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship to photograph the American Landscape and in 1980 he was granted a Photography Fellowship by the National Endowment for the Arts. In 1973 the San Francisco Museum of Art organized a 150 print exhibition of his work-the exhibit was shown at other museums in the United States. Worth's photographs are in the permanent collection of many museums around the world. Don Worth will be greatly missed by his many friends and countless former students. He is survived by his partner of fifty years Robert Narvaez. There will be no funeral service.\r\n\r\nThe above obituary appeared in the Sunday, April 5, 2009 edition of the San Francisco Chronicle.",

"Biography":"John Young Hunter was born in Glasgow, Scotland in 1874.  His father was a well-known artist and close friend of John Singer Sargent, under whom Young Hunter studied at the Royal Academy in London.  Young Hunter met with early success in England.  His work was hung at the Tate Gallery in England and in Paris at the Musee de Luxembourg.  He then spent five years in New York where he became a successful portrait painter of fashionable people.  As a boy in England, he saw the Buffalo Bill Wild West Show.  This later brought him to Taos.  In 1917 armed with a letter of introduction to Bert Phillips he became a member of the inner circle of Taos Founders and Mabel Dodge.  Eventually Young Hunter built his own studio in Taos and worked there until his death in 1955.  Young Hunter’s work has a wet bravura quality and his colors are tastefully planned.  He did watercolors of Taos, and many paintings on the Indian theme, yet he was most widely known for his portraits.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

They were among twenty-four portraits he painted for Philadelphia publisher Joseph Delaplaine's  Repository of the Lives and Portraits of Distinguished American Characters; of these, only the Jefferson portrait ended up being published. Some of the remaining portraits were exhibited in Delaplaine's Philadelphia gallery, which later became part of Rubens Peale's New York museum.\r\n\r\n",

"Biography":"Renowned photographer Stieglitz first studied photochemistry with Hermann Wilhelm Vogel at the Technische Hochschule in Berlin, from 1882-1886, and took his first photographs in 1883. He continued to travel and photograph in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland until 1890, when he returned to New York City. From 1890 to 1895 he was a partner in a photogravure firm. During this time he concentrated on photographing the streets of New York City. In 1894, Stieglitz travelled to Europe and was elected a member of the Linked Ring, a pictorialist society in London. In 1902, Stieglitz founded the Photo-Secession Movement which attempted to prove that pictorialist photography was a fine art form. From 1903 to 1917, Stieglitz was publisher and director of Camera Work magazine. The graphic section was run by Edward Steichen (1879-1973). In 1905, Stieglitz opened the Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession \"291\" on Fifth Avenue in New York City with Steichen. The galleries operated until 1917. In 1907, Stieglitz exhibited his autochrome photographs. Stieglitz stopped photographing in 1937. During his lifetime, Stieglitz was also a close friend and collaborator of Joseph T. Keiley. Together they invented the glycerine process which permitted partial development of platinum papers. Also, they produced joint research on the history of photography. Keiley also acted as the associate editor of Stieglitz's publications \"Camera Notes\" and \"Camera Works\". American photographer (ULAN).",

Stuart worked in Philadelphia from 1770-1771, working for Scottish artist Cosmo Alexander, traveling to Scotland in 1772, and returning to Rhode Island in 1773, where he paitined portraits for the next two years. During the American Revolution, Stuart lived in London where he worked in the studio of Benjamin West from 1777-1782. Combining lessons he learned from West and the work of Reynolds and Gainsborough, he gained recognition with his full length work, \"The Skater\" from 1782. Beginning in 1794, Stuart began to work on his famous portraits of Geroge Washington: \"The Vaughn Portrait\" (1794-95), reproduced on the dollar bill, \"The Athenaeum Portrait\" (1796), and the full-length \"Landsdowne Portrait\" also of 1796 (ULAN(.",

"Biography":"Although Paul Swan's name may not be immediately recognizable to contemporary audiences, he left a legacy of unique artistic accomplishments that spanned the first half of the 20th century. While his paintings dealt with a variety of themes, he was especially recognized for his exquisite portraits of notables ranging from Ezra Pound to Pope Paul VI. Swan's popular work as a dancer\/performance artist drew on Greek mythical characters as subjects-portrayed with his signature beauty, grace, and flair in American and European venues and, ultimately, at weekly performances in his Carnegie Hall studio. During his waning years, he was sadly depicted in unflattering film treatments by Andy Warhol - a far cry from his total essence. Here, Janis and Richard Londraville (Dear Yeats, Dear Pound, Dear Ford: Jeanne Robert Foster and Her Circle of Friends) present Swan's full story, carefully tracing his professional accomplishments and contributions and sensitively revealing his complex family life, personal eccentricities, and bisexual lifestyle within the context of his time, place, and culture. The authors' extensive research, access to original documents and materials, and interviews form the basis for this highly literate and engaging book, enhanced by a fine selection of photographs.\" Library Journal \"In 1965, Andy Warhol made a film in which the 82-year-old dancer and gay camp idol Paul Swan, once called \"The Most Beautiful Man in the World,\" is shown trying to recreate one of his youthful performances, unintentionally making a mockery of his past grace. The authors (Dear Yeats, Dear Pound, Dear Ford) of this insightful and compassionate biography take account of this and other pathetic aspects of Swan's old age, but for the most part they emphasize the positive side of his life. Raised on a Midwestern farm in a family dominated by a rigidly Methodist mother, Swan left home at 15, adopted a bohemian life style based on Oscar Wilde's dictum of art for art's sake, and became a successful portrait painter and sculptor as well as an actor, a poet and a leading exponent of classical dance. Bisexual, married and the father of two children, he was the quintessential eccentric, especially in his later years when he wore quantities of makeup, bathed in olive oil and stuffed his pants with socks to make himself appear better endowed. The Londravilles don't focus on these oddities. Their book succeeds because they concentrate on Swan's considerable artistic achievements, especially his accomplished portraits.\" Publishers Weekly \"Andy Warhol's film Paul Swan is an example of an icon capturing an icon in the world of high (and inside) culture. After decades of speculation about the star of the film, the Londravilles' book tells Swan's real story.\"--Billy Name-Linich, Warhol factory photographer, artist \"This remarkable study invites us to discover Paul Swan, a peculiar and fascinating presence in the world of art and dance. For the first time, in chapters ranging from an insightful commentary on Warhol's films to a fascinating account of a farm boy who becomes a 'modern Leonardo,' we see someone who can truly claim to have been 'the most beautiful man in the world.'\"--Geralyn Huxley, curator of film and video, Andy Warhol Museum. \"Dancer, painter, sculptor, poet, actor, and gay camp idol, Paul Swan was a true original. In their carefully researched biography, the Londravilles nimbly document the rich life and legacy of this long forgotten but extraordinary eccentric whose narcissistic antics--all in the name of art--entranced the likes of Marcel Duchamp, Roberto Matta, and Andy Warhol.\"--Paul B. Franklin, editor in chief of the journal Etant donne Marcel Duchamp (Paris) \"When Paul Swan exhibited with Robert Henri, Maurice Prendergast, and Rockwell Kent at the Macbeth Gallery in 1914, he was in an elite company of American painters; and when he won awards at the Paris Salons in the 1930s, he was showing with the best in the Western world. Finally, with this biography, we have the intriguing story of Swan's art, his life, and his loves.\"--Aaron H. DeGroft, deputy director and chief curator of the Ringling Museum of Art at the State Art Museum of Florida \r\n",

"Biography":"The artist Marion Swinton of Hackensack, New Jersey, was born on Staten Island, New York around 1860. She was a daughter of the painter Alfred Swinton from London, England and Mary Demarest of New York City. Swinton’s family moved to Ho-Ho-Kus, New Jersey, in the early 1870s. The young artist studied with her father before entering the school of William Merritt Chase in New York City. She also trained with F. Louis Mora at the National Academy of Design in New York. \r\nAround 1904 the Swinton family relocated to Hackensack, where they would own a house at 407 State Street for some 35 years. Around 1906 Swinton visited London, where one of her portraits was exhibited at the Royal Institute of Painters.(1) From 1907 to about 1917, she kept an apartment and studio at the Van Dyck Studios on Eighth Avenue in Manhattan; during this period she spent summers at the family home in Hackensack.(2) \r\nDuring her years in New York City, the artist painted a well-known portrait of Woodrow Wilson (1915). She also exhibited in the first show of the Society of Independent Artists (1917). \r\nDuring the early 1920s, Swinton was active in Hackensack; later that decade she apparently stayed for a time in Montreal, where her portraits were photographed at the studio of William Notman. The photographs, dated 1926-1927, are now at the McCord Museum. \r\nSwinton and her sisters, Lucy and Clara, lived in the family home in Hackensack for the rest of their lives. During the latter part of her career, the artist devoted her time to art instruction. She was also active as the local chairman of the League of Nations Non-Partisan Association in Hackensack. \r\nMarion Swinton died at home in Hackensack on February 12, 1939, and was buried at Valleau Cemetery in Ridgewood, New Jersey.(3) \r\nArt and Architecture of N.J. http:\/\/www.ettc.net\/njarts\/details.cfm?ID=1274\r\n",

"Biography":"Swedish artist Thure de Thulstrup came to New Orleans in 1902 to paint a large painting commemorating the hundredth anniversary of the transfer of the Louisiana territory from France to the United States. Commissioned for exhibit at the St. Louis World’s Fair of 1903, the painting was well received. Since the fair, the painting has been on continuous display in the Cabildo, the flagship building of the Louisiana State Museum. Later, the museum acquired de Thulstrup’s cartoon drawing for the painting. \r\nDe Thulstrup selected the dramatic moment when the American flag was raised in place of the French flag in the middle of Place d’Armes (today Jackson Square). A company of American soldiers and spectators fill the square celebrating the transfer. In keeping with historical accuracy, de Thulstrup painted the Cabildo and St. Louis Cathedral as they appeared in 1803. The Cabildo is shown lacking the mansard roofed third story added by the Baroness Pontalba in the 1850s.\r\n\r\nBorn into a distinguished diplomatic family, de Thulstrup was educated at a military academy in Stockholm, served in the French Foreign Legion and in the Franco-Prussian War. Initially, he studied art in Paris and continued his studies at the Art Student’s League in New York City. Combining his military knowledge with his artistic pursuits, he specialized in war and naval scenes. In New York, he enjoyed a successful career as an illustrator for Frank Leslie’s Illustrated Newspaper and the New York Daily Graphic. During the Spanish-American War, he worked as an illustrator and correspondent for Harper’s Weekly and Collier’s. He illustrated numerous books, including those by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Francis Hopkins Smith.\r\n",

"Biography":"Herk van Tongeren, a sculptor, died Thursday, apparently of a heart attack, in Seattle. He was 43 years old and lived in Hopewell, N.J. Mr. van Tongeren was known for small, elegant, finely crafted bronze sculptures that grew out of the ''Metaphysical'' paintings of Giorgio de Chirico and the Surrealist sculptures of Alberto Giacometti. Most of them looked like miniature stage sets occupied by geometrical props rather than by people. The walls, columns and steps of the theaters were mysterious and incomplete. They suggested Greek and Roman theaters, but it was unclear who would take their place on stage and what roles they would assume. If the imagery was in some way inscrutable, however, the surfaces were highly finished, and the edges, shapes and arrangements were carefully resolved. Mr. van Tongeren was born in Holland, Mich., and received bachelor of arts and master of fine arts degrees from the University of Colorado. He taught at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, San Diego State University, the University of British Columbia in Vancouver and the University of California at Berkeley. Mr. van Tongeren was a fixture in exhibitions of bronze sculpture, and in recent years he began experimenting with a larger scale. He was executive director of the Johnson Atelier Foundry in Mercerville, N.J., a center for bronze casting. His work is in the collections of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and the Brooklyn Museum. He is survived by a son, Trygve; his mother, Mrs. Frank Smith of Lincoln, Calif., and his father, Herk Sr., of Denver.\r\n\r\nThe above NYTimes obituary taken from <http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1987\/02\/09\/obituaries\/herk-van-tongeren-sculptor.html>",

"Biography":"American porcelain manufactory. William Ellis Tucker (b Philadelphia, 11 June 1800; d Philadelphia, 22 Aug 1832) made an enormous contribution to the history of American ceramics as the founder of this major porcelain factory in Philadelphia. His interest in ceramics probably stemmed from working with the material in his father’s china store, where he occasionally painted European blanks and fired them in a small kiln. Experiments to make porcelain began in 1825. Funding the experiments and later the production of porcelain was so expensive that partners were acquired to help alleviate the financial problems. The factory was known under various titles, chiefly Tucker & Hulme (1828) and Tucker & Hemphill (1831–8). After Tucker’s death, production continued with his brother Thomas Tucker (1812–90) as manager. Tableware and decorative pieces in the fashionable French Empire style were the main products of the firm. Although the company stayed in business until 1838, financial stability was always elusive, as European porcelain was cheaper than Tucker’s.",

"Biography":"VANDERLYN, John, artist, born in Kingston, Ulster County, New York, 15 October, 1775; died there, 24 September, 1852. After receiving an education at Kingston academy, he went to Yew York, where he engaged in business, and devoted his leisure to art, attending the drawing-school of Archibald Robertson. Subsequently he went to Philadelphia, where he spent some time in the studio of Gilbert Stuart, and copied his portraits of Aaron Burr and Egbert Benson. Through the generosity of Aaron Burr, who heard of the young artist's difficulties. Vanderlyn was enabled to continue his studies. In 1796 he went to France, where he remained for five years. After his return in 1802 he painted two views of Niagara falls, which were engraved and published (London, 1804), and portraits of Burr and his daughter. The following year he went abroad again, and spent several years in England and Paris, where he painted for Joel Barlow the \" Death of Bliss McCrea.\" In 1805 he visited Rome, and there painted, in 1807, his \" Marius amid the Ruins of Carthage.\" On his return to Paris the following year he exhibited it at the salon, where it gained for him the Napoleon gold medal. This painting belongs now to Bishop Kip, of California. He also executed various copies after the old masters, and in 1812 painted his famous \"Ariadne.\" This picture was subsequently bought, and engraved by Asher B. Durand, and is now in the Pennsylvania academy of fine arts. He returned to the United States in 1815, and painted portraits of various eminent men, including Washington (for the National house of representatives), James Monroe, John C. Calhoun, Governor Joseph C Yates, Governor George Clinton, Andrew Jackson, and Zachary Taylor. At this time he projected also a panoramic exhibition, and erected in Yew York the \" Rotunda.\" He exhibited there panoramas of Paris, Athens, Mexico, Versailles (by himself), and some battle-pieces; but the enterprise was not successful, and the building passed out of his hands. This, and the want of appreciation for the arts in this country, seem to have dispirited and embittered him. His last large composition picture, \"The Landing of Columbus,\" painted in Paris for one of the panels in the capitol at Washington, is hardly more than respectable. It was engraved for the United States five-dollar banknotes. Vanderlyn will always be known as the painter of \"Marius\" and \"Ariadne,\" which latter, though scarcely showing great originality, is a noble work. The New York historical society owns his portraits of Aaron Burr. Robert R. Livingston (1804), Roger Strong, and Henry Benson (1823).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEdited Appletons Encyclopedia, Copyright © 2001 VirtualologyTM",

"Biography":"Hubert Vos was a Dutch painter who was born in Maastricht in 1855. He studied at the Académie des Beaux Arts in Brussels and with Fernand Cormon (1845-1924) in Paris. He exhibited widely in Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels, Dresden and Munich. From 1885 to 1892, he worked in England, where he exhibited at the Royal Academy between 1888 and 1891. He was a member of the Royal Society of British Artists.\r\n\r\nIn 1898, He visited Hawaii, where he painted the local people. In that same year, Vos travelled to Korea, where he completed at least three paintings in duplicate. In each case, he left one copy in Korea and kept one copy. The paintings are a life-sized portrait of Emperor Gojong, a portrait of Min Sang-ho (1870-1933) and a landscape of Seoul. The copies left in Korea hung in the Deoksugung Palace until all except the landscape of Seoul,were destroyed by fire in 1904. In 1905, on his second and last trip around the world, Vos became the second western painter to paint a portrait of China’s Empress Dowager Tzu Hsi (1835-1908).\r\n\r\nIn addition to portraits and landscapes, Vos is known for his interior scenes and still-life paintings of Chinese porcelains. He died in New York City in 1935.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago History Museum, the Fogg Art Museum (Harvard University), the Honolulu Academy of Arts, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Smithsonian American Art Museum are among he public collections having paintings by Hubert Vos.\r\n\r\n",

"Biography":"Ogden M. Pleissner was considered a Realist unimpeded by sentimentality. He began his art training at the Brooklyn Friends School and later attended the Art Students League. Pleissner’s first canvases were of the Grand Tenton Mountains in Wyoming. He became best known for his watercolors of New England scenes. During WWII, Pleissner painted for the Air Force and Life Magazine featured his work based on the Normandy breakthrough. His post-war subjects became concerned with urban life in France, Italy and Spain. Pleissner had precision and clarity in the sense of light that comes through in many of his paintings. This combined with his selection of only pictorial elements that contribute to an overall composition, really characterize his work. Pleissner was also the director and trustee of the Tiffany Foundation. He died in 1983.\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/www.caldwellgallery.com\/bios\/pleissnerbio.html",

"Biography":"Born 6 December 1901, Porter took up photography in 1930. He taught biochemistry at Harvard University until 1939, when he became a professional freelance photographer in Cambridge, Massachusetts, after being encouraged by Ansel Adams and Alfred Stieglitz. In 1940, Porter began to specialize in colour photography. From 1944 to 1946, Porter worked as a freelance landscape and wildlife photographer in Winnetka, Illinois. In 1946, Porter settled in Santa Fe, New Mexico, where he photographed birds for Audubon Magazine. In 1955-1956, Porter travelled to Mexico with photographer Ellen Auerbach to photograph Mexican churches. From 1967 to 1971, Porter took three photographic trips to Greece and Turkey. Porter undertook three expeditions to photograph in Antarctica from 1975 to 1977. Many of his nature photographs are firmly linked with the Sierra Club and its promotion of conservation causes. He died 2 November 1990. ULAN",

During the 1880s, he traveled through the Dakotas, Montana, the Arizona Territory, and Texas, returning to New York in 1885, with the desire to record the vanishing wilderness. In 1895, he began to exhibit his bronzes of cowboys and horses in motion. After 1900, his illustrative style shifted to one of Impressionism, as he became influenced by the work of Monet, Childe Hassam, and John H. Twatchman. In addition to his paintings and sculpture, he wrote eight books and numerous short stories on the Wild West (ULAN).",

"Biography":"James Rosenquist studied at the University of Minnesota and in 1955 received a bursary from the Art Students League of New York. With Lichtenstein and Oldenburg, James Rosenquist is one of the masters of American Pop Art, a movement inspired by the consumer society, reacting against the aestheticism of Abstract Expressionism and using techniques taken from the worlds of the press, cinema and advertising. Rosenquist's work is situated after the movement's neo-Dada forerunners, Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, Chamberlain and Stankiewicz, with the first representatives of the second wave of Pop Art, who came together in 1962 and would launch the vogue for this second American postwar style.\r\n\r\nLike other future exponents of Pop Art, he worked for a long time as a commercial artist, using his professional techniques in his later work. He also retained the visual associations of advertising with erotic connotations and a highly personal color sense. One of the bases of Pop Art is the observation that the great myths of the modern world, can now be found in the temples of the consumer society, the comic strips of the popular daily press, advertising hoardings, the heroes of cinema and so on. For Rosenquist, who retains in his personal work the impersonal techniques of mass-produced commercial imagery, the visual idea alone matters. Instead of using elements from advertising reproduced more or less unchanged, Rosenquist reworks them from photographs he takes himself. The scale of the objects or fragments of objects varies within a single painting, different points of view combine and while some elements are clear at once, others remain hard to identify and affect the viewer only through their juxtaposition. I Love You with my Ford of 1964 consists of three rectangular and contiguous strips showing a car radiator, the face of a woman whose neck is being kissed and a close-up of spaghetti in tomato sauce. By excessively enlarging everyday objects, he forces us to see them out of context. Unlike other Pop artists, Rosenquist does not isolate a single object in order to make it visible, but shows it in a way that is almost 'abstract'. The composition forces viewers to move in order to grasp the object; their eyes must adapt and avoid all that does not interest them directly. In reversing pictorial conventions in this way and disturbing the viewers' way of seeing, Rosenquist constantly obliges them to make choices. His collages, the size of poster advertisements, remain Pop Art's most enigmatic and provocative images. In addition to painting, Rosenquist also explores the possibilities of different media and works in the round. From 1966 he painted the same subjects, taken from advertising, on strips of transparent plastic which were then hung in the exhibition space, such as Sliced Bologna of 1968, enabling the viewer to pass through the painting and move in its space.\r\n\r\nPop Art has been criticized for presenting a distorted and unfaithful representation of reality, but in fact the aims of artists like Rosenquist were closer to those of the American Post-Constructivists and Minimalists than to, for example, the New Realists. His color range is unusual in that all the shades are mixed with white, and his later works bring him closer to the abstraction of Noland and Kelly.\r\n\r\nSource: Benezit Dictionary of Art\r\n",

"Biography":"Irish-born U.S. sculptor. Son of an Irish mother and a French father, he was brought to the U.S. in infancy and at 13 was apprenticed to a cameo cutter. He studied sculpture in New York and at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris (1867 - 70), then settled in New York City in 1872. Between 1880 and 1897 he executed most of the works that earned him his reputation as the foremost American sculptor of the late 19th century. His first important commission was the monument to David Farragut (1878 - 81) in New York's Madison Square Park. For Boston he produced his great relief monument to Col. Robert G. Shaw and his African American Civil War regiment (1884 - 97). The memorial to the wife of Henry Adams (1886 - 91) in Washington, D.C., a mysterious draped figure with a shadowed face, is often considered his greatest work.\r\n\r\nSource: Britannica Concise Encyclopedia\r\n",

"Biography":"Landscape painter William Sartain, in 1877, was known primarily for his Tonalist paintings, especially scenes of the tidal wetlands of Nonquitt, Massachusetts, where he spent many summers, and along the Manasquam River in New Jersey, where he often traveled on weekends.\r\n\r\nHe helped found the Society of American Artists.  While Sartain evolved to broadly handled, painterly landscapes of coastal subject matter, his early work included heads and canal and street scenes of Venice and Algiers.  Despite modest sales, his dealer was the well-known William MacBeth of New York City.  Exhibition venues included the Brooklyn Art Association, Pennsylvania Academy, the National Academy of Design and the Boston Art Club.\r\n\r\nArtist Celia Beaux said Sartain gave her her first valuable art instruction, and she studied with him for two years, 1881-1883, beginning with a class organized by a wealthy art-student friend.  Sartain, then living in New York City, sometimes traveled to Philadelphia to substitute for Thomas Eakins in the latter's classes at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.  In Philadelphia in the early 1880s, the reputations of Sartain and Eakins attracted the majority of students seriously interested in art.\r\n\r\nSartain was a believer in phrenology, and taught his portraiture students that the proportions of the head \"revealed much about the worth and character of an individual.\" (Carter 65)\r\n\r\nAs a beginning artist, Sartain had to establish himself as a painter in the eyes of his parents, especially his father, who actively interfered with his son's chosen career.  At age thirty-three in 1876 when William sought exhibition space in the International Centennial Exposition at Philadelphia, his father, John Sartain, who was Secretary of the new Pennsylvania Academy at the time, and Director of the art section of the Exposition, refused to allow William to enter because he did not respect what his son was doing. \r\n\r\nIt is possible that the father, once a mezzotint engraver, felt outdone by his son's aspirations to be a painter, especially when his son expressed that he wanted to go beyond the early training supplied by the father.  Such a painful rejection caused the son so much grief that William Sartain, in a fit of depression, destroyed much of his early work. \r\n\r\nWilliam Sartain was born in 1843 in Philadelphia.  His father was an administrator and entrepreneur, involved in publishing as well as engraving, and he had taught the mezzotint craft to his other children, Emily and Samuel, in addition to William, who went on to study with Christian Schussele at the Pennsylvania Academy, the precursor of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.\r\n\r\nSartain and Thomas Eakins were life-long friends, having met at school.  They traveled to Paris in 1869, sharing a studio.  Sartain, who came to know the family of artist-pioneer Rosa Bonheur, studied with Adolphe Yvon, Leon Bonnat in his Montmartre studio, and at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts.  During this period, Sartain and Eakins and H. Humphrey Moore traveled to Spain and Algiers.  Sartain lived in Paris until 1875, when he returned to Philadelphia and to the events involving his father's rejection for the Exhibition.\r\n\r\nAfter returning from Europe, he lived primarily in New York City, deciding to avoid Philadelphia where his father's influence was so dominant in the art world.\r\n\r\nWilliam Sartain died in 1924.  Since he never married, there was no one to look after the many works he left behind, and large numbers were destroyed. \r\n\r\nAvailable paintings may be found in the collections of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia; Philadelphia Museum of Art; Brooklyn Museum; and National Museum of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\nSources: \r\nDavid Michael Zellman, 300 Years of American Art\r\nPeter Falk, Who Was Who in American Art\r\nAlice Carter, Cecilia Beaux, A Modern Painter in the Gilded Age\r\n \r\n\r\n** If you discover credit omissions or have additional information to add, please let us know at registrar@AskART.com. \r\n \r\n  \r\n \r\n",

"Biography":"American sculptor best known for his life-size sculptures of human figures set in environments. Although he began as a figurative painter in the late 1950's along with artists such as Allan Kaprow and George Brecht, he turned to sculpture in order to explore the human figure as it relates to actual space and its surroundings. Segal's early work is often treated within the framework of Pop Art, because of the reference to the individual's position within mass culture and the examination of the relationship between fine and popular art. Later his work reflected social concerns. These works consist of plaster molds cast from living models in order to capture life like gestures, placed in environmental tableaux, which lock them in time. Although most of his figures remain white, in his later work he began painting them in vivid colors. Artist (ULAN).",

"Biography":"First professor of modern art history at Princeton University;  curator of the Department of Painting and Sculpture Exhibitions, Museum of Modern Art, New York 1960-70. Seitz began his career as an artist, studying at Albright Art School, the Art Institute of Buffalo. He married fellow artist Irma J. Siegelman in 1938.  Seitz worked for the Federal Artists Project during the Depression and as a draftsman for a rubber company in Buffalo before earning a BFA from the University of Buffalo in 1948. He taught at the university there and the state teacher's college until 1949.  He spent a year in Europe before attending Princeton University the next year where he held a one-person show in the Art Museum.  Although enrolled in the MFA program, Seitz was already lobbying to be allowed to study abstract expressionism, then a current movement in the art world.   Princeton Dept. of Art and Archaeology Chair E. Baldwin Smith (q.v.) queried Princeton alumnus (and founder of the Museum of Modern Art, New York) Alfred Barr, Jr. (q.v.) on the suitability of this as a subject for academic study and of Seitz's proposal.  The famous exchange of letters is now in the archives of the Museum of Modern Art.  Much of the Princeton faculty remained divided on Seitz and the subject, but eventually Seitz succeeded and, in 1955, completed the first dissertation on Abstract Expressionism.  He was immediately appointed to the Princeton faculty as critic in residence and assistant professor.  Seitz became a rallying point for students of the \"new art\"--both painters and those in art history.  He founded the first non-credit painting studio at Princeton, where he advised painting students, among whom were Frank Stella. Seitz also instituted the first artist-in-residence program at Princeton.  In 1960 Seitz, always known as \"Bill,\" became Curator of the Department of Painting and Sculpture Exhibitions at the Museum of Modern Art.  Here his seminal exhibitions, \"The Art of Assemblage\" and \"The Responsive Eye\" brought to the fore genres of art lesser known modern art to the public.  Twenty years later Hilton Kramer referred to Seitz's inaugural Monet retrospective, \"Claude Monet: Season and Moments,\" as the \"the great Monet show.\"  Seitz also mounted exhibitions of artists as disparate as Mark Tobey, Hans Hofmann and Edward Hopper.  He rose rapidly in the modern art world.  Between 1965-1970 he was Professor of Fine Arts at Brandeis University and director of the Rose Art Museum there. He organized the United States exhibition at the Ninth Biennial in Sao Paulo (1967) and the Seventh Biennial of Canadian Painting (1968).  In 1970 he became the William R. Kennan Jr. Professor of Art at the University of Virginia, taking the year 1972-73 as the Kress Professor at the National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C. At age 60 he contracted cancer and died at a Charlottesville hospital. \r\n\r\nAs an art historian, Seitz was able to bridge the world of museums and academics, of practicing (studio) art and art history.  He brought to modern art history the visual analysis of the painter's eye, often using a technical explanation of a work as a key to its intellectual content.  He was responsible for raising the study of contemporary art to an academic discipline.   His early and continued espousal of the work of Stella--recommending him for Oberlin's \"Three Young Americans\" show in 1958 and at the Museum of Modern Art (\"Responsive Eye,\" 1965)--were essential for that artist's career. \r\n\r\nHome Country:  United States \r\n\r\nSources:  \"A Continued Story:  Alfred H.

"Biography":"Harriet R. Hyatt Mayor was born in Salem, Mass. in 1868, the daughter of Audella Beebe Hyatt and Alpheus Hyatt II, the noted paleontologist. After traveling abroad with her family at an early age she began to show artistic tendencies. She studied art and sculpture in Boston and began a promising career. She encouraged her sister Anna to join her in sculpting. Harriet was married in 1900 to Alfred Goldsborough Mayor and soon began to raise a family. Alfred G. Mayor, son of Alfred M. Mayor, the noted physicist, was an outstanding natural scientist in his own right. He and his wife spent 22 happy years together and had four children, A. Hyatt, Katharine, Brantz, and Barbara. \r\n\r\nMrs. Mayor suffered a slight attack of tuberculosis in 1912 and went abroad with her children. She barely escaped Germany before World War I began. After Dr. Mayor's death in 1922, Mrs. Mayor busied herself with other activities: she traveled in Europe, she also became active in the Daughters of the American Revolution and long served as regent of the Princeton, New Jersey chapter. This association contributed to her interest in genealogy (as well as her mother's similar interest) and she made studies of the Hyatt and Mayor family trees. She lived most of her later years in Princeton, only leaving to live with her sister Anna (Mrs. Archer M. Huntington) during her last year. She died at the Huntington estate in Bethel, Conn., in 1960 at the age of 92. \r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/library.syr.edu\/digital\/guides\/m\/mayor_hrh.htm\r\n",

"Biography":"Julius Garibaldi Melchers-named for the Italian patriot Giuseppi Garibaldi-was born in Detroit, Michigan, in 1860. His father Julius (1829-1908), a Prussian-born sculptor, was his first art teacher. Even so, young Gari's passion was for painting, not sculpture.\r\n\r\nAt seventeen, Melchers entered the Royal Prussian Academy of Art in Dusseldorf, Germany. The curriculum emphasized figure painting characterized by well-modeled form, hard-edged realism and the finish of the Old Masters. Dusseldorf's academic regimen formed the basis of Melchers' mature style.\r\n\r\nMelchers continued his training at the Ecole de Beaux-Arts and the Académie Julian in Paris in 1881, studying under Jules Lefebvre and Gustave Boulanger. For Melchers, who was already advanced in his training, the Ecole provided little in terms of technique, but his experiences there and at Julian's would affect his development as a leader of the American school of painters in Paris.\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/www.umw.edu\/gari_melchers\/melchers\/default.php\r\n\r\nWhile still a student, Melchers fell under the spell of the French Naturalist painters, led by Jules Bastien-Lepage (1848-1884). Lepage painted unidealized views of contemporary country life. His pictures were painted in open-air light and combined vigorous brushwork and brilliant color with an exacting eye for place and personality.\r\n\r\nIn 1884, Melchers joined another American expatriate, George Hitchcock (1850-1913), at Egmond-aan-Zee, Holland. There the two artists founded an art colony and built reputations as chroniclers of Dutch peasant life. Melchers' landmark painting, The Sermon, 1886, was painted in Egmond. It is a monumental canvas in which the painter portrayed a young peasant girl asleep during a church service. Special emphasis was given to descriptive detail and narrative. This honest characterization of working-class life became one of the day's most beloved examples of rustic naturalism. Fittingly, over the door to his studio he nailed a plaque proclaiming his artistic credo \"Waar en Klaar\" (Dutch for \"true and clear\").\r\n\r\nThe Communion, The Pilots and The Choirmaster followed, garnering him an international audience, especially in America and Germany, where sentiment ran high for the piety and work ethic of the peasant class.\r\n\r\nIn 1889, Melchers reached the height of his career when he and John Singer Sargent became the first two American painters to be distinguished with a Grand Prize at the Paris Universal Exposition. This honor stamped the twenty-nine year old Melchers as the leading American proponent of Naturalism.\r\n\r\nMural painting was yet another avenue down which he directed his talents, including decorations for the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago and in 1895, the new Library of Congress in Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\nThe1890s saw his best portrait work, subjects with names like Vanderbilt, Mellon and Roosevelt ensuring his reputation and earning him his greatest financial reward. His most original pictorial format became anonymous portraiture: paintings whose titles identify the subject's vocation rather than identity —The Sailor and His Dog, The Fencer, and The Shipbuilder.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Melchers also began to experiment with the portrayal of biblical subjects from a contemporary perspective, in emulation of the style of the German painter Fritz von Uhde. The Nativity is the finest example of his work in that genre.\r\n\r\nDrawing on his association with Belgian art circles and his friendship with the French Symbolist painter Puvis de Chavannes, Melchers began to invest scenes of everyday life with spiritual overtones (The Bride). Often he took these pictures a step further, endowing wholesome peasant girls with supernatural haloes that transform them into modern metaphors for the spiritual life.\r\n\r\nAt the turn of the century, Melchers entered a phase of greater decorative consciousness in which he emphasized vibrant color, natural lighting, looser brushwork and decorative pattern. This modified Impressionist style provided a better vehicle for his new interest in the subject of modern women and children portrayed in beautiful interiors and gardens (At Home, (Winged Victory); The Unpretentious Garden, The Open Door and The Christening). Interestingly, the pronounced gaiety of his work in this period coincides with his recent marriage to a young American art student, Corinne Mackall.\r\n\r\nOut-of-doors, Melchers concentrated on recording the poetic effects of light and atmosphere in Impressionist-inspired landscapes like Bryant Park (Twilight), Hudson River and The Wartburg, building on what would become a favorite topic in his later years.\r\n\r\nAs an expatriate, Melchers enjoyed his greatest popularity in Germany, where in 1909 he accepted an appointment as Professor of Art at the Grand Ducal Saxony School of Art in Weimar. There he remained until the First World War had all but shut down the school.\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that Melchers began to experiment with the nude as subject matter, doing so on a large and provocative scale. Young Woman at Her Toilet is an example of what would become a major preoccupation of the artist until the end of his career.\r\n\r\nMelchers returned to the U.S. in 1915 to open a studio at the Beaux-Arts building at Bryant Park in New York City. He began the final chapter of his career by assuming leadership and organizational roles within the art community there. He was an academician of the National Academy of Design, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and served as president of the New Society of Artists from 1920-1928.\r\n\r\nMelchers longed to escape the city for a pastoral retreat much like the one he and his wife had enjoyed in Holland. They found their country get-a-way at Belmont, an eighteenth century estate in Falmouth, Virginia, near Fredericksburg. Here Melchers was happiest painting for the sake of painting itself. He took up his brush to paint pure and figurative landscapes like never before, probably on account of his regular association with leading American Impressionists like Childe Hassam, John Twachtman, and Edward Redfield, to name a few (A Native of Virginia, The Hunters and St. George's Church).\r\n\r\nDespite his advancing years, Melchers was named to the Virginia Art Commission, chaired the Smithsonian Commission to Establish a National Gallery of Art (today's Smithsonian American Art Museum) and was elected trustee of the Corcoran Gallery of Art.\r\n\r\nGari Melchers died at Belmont in 1932, just as a major retrospective of his work opened to the public in New York. The show was well attended due to the high regard held for him by his contemporaries. Nevertheless, his international renown had already begun to fade. Yet while Gari Melchers' canvases may never place him alongside his more famous contemporaries, his story is well worth telling. Indeed, without the story so well preserved at Belmont, the tale of an entire generation of American artistic endeavor is incomplete. \r\n",

Like George Ohr and Walter Anderson, his roots in art began on the Gulf Coast.  Meyer served as an apprentice in his father’s pottery studio in Biloxi.  In 1879, Joseph Meyer invited George Ohr to join him as an apprentice at his New Orleans pottery business.  From mentor to George Ohr to master potter, Joseph Meyer threw pottery at Sophie Newcomb College in New Orleans while maintaining a home and making pottery on Deer Island across from the Ohr-O’Keefe Museum of Art.  The exhibition features 34 pieces of Joseph Meyer pottery, c. 1900, as well as one piece of Newcomb Pottery, from the collection of the Ohr-O’Keefe Museum of Art. (Ohr-O'Keefe Museum of Art)",

"Biography":"Albert Ketcham Murray, a native of Kansas, studied art at Cornell University and then graduated cum laude from Syracuse University. He also studied in England and France and received special tutelage for two years in Mexico from the noted portrait artist Wayman E. Adams. By the late 1930's, Mr. Murray was exhibiting his paintings at such prestigious art institutions as the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, D.C., and the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh.\r\n\r\nIn March 1942 he was commissioned a lieutenant and line officer in the U. S. Naval Reserve and was soon transferred to the service's new combat art program. He painted portraits of the members of the Navy's General Board and did a series of paintings of crew members from the damaged cruiser the \"U.S.S. Boise.\" He was assigned to the Fourth Fleet in the South Atlantic, then to the Eighth Fleet in the Mediterranean, where his dog tags were shot off while he painted scenes of the invasion of Southern France. Mr. Murray also was awarded the Bronze Star and promoted to the rank of commander.\r\n\r\n     After the war, he remained on active duty to paint a series of portraits of the Navy's top-ranking flag officers in their wartime roles, including Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz signing the peace accord with Japan aboard the \"U.S.S. Missouri.\" He was awarded the Navy's Meritorious Public Service Award and the Navy's Distinguished Public Service Award. After the war, he resumed his career as a portraitist, maintaining a studio in New York City. He died in 1992.\r\n\r\nBiography by Marion S. Gilliland, from the catalog of the retrospective exhibition of Albert Murray's work at Christie's New York, December 19 - 21, 1995.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

"Biography":"Eadweard Muybridge was born Edward James Muggeridge but he adopted the Saxon spelling of his name early in his life. Muybridge came to the United States in 1852 where he worked as a publisher and a book-dealer. He returned to England in 1860 and began photographing. By 1867 he returned to California and sold photographic views using the pseudonym \"Helios.\" During this time, he was commissioned by Leland Stanford to study the motion of a trotting horse using photographic methods. Muybridge abandonded the experiments in 1873 while he travelled to Central America, but began them again when he returned in 1877. His experiments with capturing motion using photography became more in-depth as he designed a faster shutter and a technique for using shorter exposures. The resulting photographs allowed him to successfully analyze each individual stage of motion of a horse trotting, and the published photographs earned him a name with the public. He also performed additional experiments using multiple cameras to capture motion, and designed a projecting device for drawings derived from his photographs called a 'zoopraxiscope'. This device allowed him to illustrate how artists in the past had inaccurately represented motion in their paintings and drawings. In 1884, Muybridge began working at the University of Pennsylvania, where he continued his experiments using multiple cameras to study human and animal motion. Many of his photographs were reproduced in his landmark publication 'Animal Locomotion'. Today Muybridge's photographic innovations are considered a precursor to modern motion pictures. British photographer. (ULAN)",

She was an American painter, trained in Chicago and New York where she came into contact with modern developments in art, as well as non-western traditions and photography. Her husband, the photographer Alfred Steiglitz showed her work yearly until his death in 1946. O'Keeffe is best known for extreme close-up images of abstracted natural forms, such as flowers, animal bones, clouds, and landscapes. From 1929 she spent most of her summers painting in New Mexico, moving there permanently in 1949. In 1971, she learned to be a hand-potter. American artist (ULAN).",

He quickly became involved in performance art after moving to New York and meeting many performance artists. By 1959, he had created drawings and collages of common objects and renderings of grotesque human figures. He created The Store in his studio, a performance space that re-created a neighborhood of shops that displayed goods that were made of plaster. He emerged as a leading Pop artist, combining consumer culture into his own sculptures. Oldenburg married artist Coosje van Bruggen in 1977. The two collaborated on many large-scale projects together and with architect Frank O. Gehry in the mid-1970s and early 1990s. (ULAN)",

"Biography":"Rembrandt Peale (February 22, 1778–October 3, 1860) was a 19th century American artist that received critical acclaim for his portraits of presidents George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. Although modern art critics would consider Peale’s artwork as French neoclassical, its dark and stylized characteristics are similar to 15th and 16th century paintings.\r\n\r\nRembrandt Peale was born the third of six surviving children (eleven had died) to his mother, Rachel Brewer, and father, Charles Willson Peale in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, on February 22, 1778. The father, Charles, also a notable artist, taught each child to paint scenery and portraiture, and Rembrandt was no exception. Charles tutored Rembrandt about the importance of having a strong mind from learning arts and sciences. At the age of eight, Rembrandt discovered drawing, and at thirteen, painted his first known self-portrait. Later on in his life, Rembrandt Peale \"often showed this painting to young beginners, to encourage them to go from 'bad' to better...\" like his steady progressions to become a successful portraitist[1].\r\n\r\nIn July of 1787, Charles Willson Peale introduced Rembrandt to George Washington, where the young aspirant artist watched his father paint the remarkable figure of the country. In 1795, at the age of 17, Rembrandt painted an aging Washington, though the painter had depicted the politician as far more aged than the original facial characteristics. It did, nevertheless attain praise and Rembrandt had begun his debut. Later on, Peale made over 70 detailed replicas of the same \"father of our country\", the first President of the United States. After the 1st president's death, the Patriæ Pater made its debut in 1824, where Peale received commendations for his portrait of the first president (Ward). Peale continued to paint other noted portraits, such as those of the third president Thomas Jefferson while he was in office (1805), and later on a portrait of Chief Justice John Marshall.\r\n\r\nA year after his mother’s death and remarriage of his father, Rembrandt Peale left school of the arts, thereby applying his time to completing his first ever self-portrait at the age of 13. The canvas illustrates early mastery of a young aspiring artist, seeming very mature. The clothes, however give the notion that Peale over-exaggerated what a 13 year old would look like. This style demonstrates early forms of neoclassicism by the looks of Peale's angel-like hair, the way it waves and curls in such a fashion so as to depict an angel from a general Renaissance artist's works of art.[2]\r\n\r\nAt the age of 20, Rembrandt married 22-year-old Eleanor May Short (1776-1836) at St. Joseph's Catholic Church in Philadelphia.[3] During their marriage, Rembrandt and Eleanor had nine children: Rosalba, Eleanor, Sarah Miriam, Michael Angelo, Emma Clara,\r\n\r\n\r\n[edit] Travels\r\n \r\nRembrandt Peale, Self-portrait, 1828, Detroit Institute of ArtsThroughout his entire life, Rembrandt Peale had traveled across the Western Hemisphere in search for a better life as an artist. Noted for his \"itinerant\" nature, Rembrandt visited Europe several times to study art (Ward). His father helped pay his way to Paris, France in June to September of 1808, and October 1809 to November 1810. While in Paris, Jacques Louis-David's art had influenced him to paint in the Neoclassical genre. He painted the famous explorer Alexander von Humboldt and several other noted patrons such as Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and François André Michaux. After his successes in France, in 1810 Peale returned to Philadelphia to develop into a thriving painter. He had made endless efforts to establish his knowledge and mastery of art, in painting \"The Roman Daughter\" (1812). While the economy was suffering financially during the War of 1812, President Jefferson had promised to buy the 1795 portrait of Washington or Peale would travel to Europe for better success. However acknowledgeable of his portrait, Jefferson could not keep his promise, and encouraged Peale to go to Europe, as \"we have genius among us but no unemployed wealth to reward it\" as the economy continued to fall into debt[4]\r\n\r\nIn 1828, an ambitious Peale raised funds and tried at earning money for his previous paintings, in order to travel to Rome, Italy. By the time he had enough money, he decided to take his 15-year-old son, Michael Angelo, a determined young artist who copied his father's paintings in admiration.[5] Peale successfully displayed portraits of Horatio Greenough and Patriæ Pater in Florence Academy.\r\n\r\n\r\n[edit] Peale's Baltimore Museum\r\nMotivated by his father’s establishment of the American Museum of Philadelphia (1786) and having been unsuccessful in Philadelphia, Rembrandt Peale assumed his father’s role in another city. On August 15, 1814, Peale launched his first museum as soon as he arrived in the municipality of Baltimore, Maryland. Originally premeditated as an Arts and Sciences museum, Peale decided to display only works of art and manufactured products instead.\r\n\r\nThe museum was elaborately illuminated by gas light, following the example of his brother Rubens in Philadelphia. This innovation made a great impression. Peale had acquired an important gas lighting patent, and with some associates founded the successful Gas Light Company of Baltimore. Having poor business sense, though, he did little to manage the company and was forced out after a few years, due to the War of 1812 and soon after, the disinterest of many townspeople. If Rembrandt Peale had not built and established the Peale Museum of Baltimore during the War of 1812, the museum would persist as a successful institution today.[6][7]\r\n\r\n\r\n[edit] Rembrandt Peale’s Studio: Works of Art and their Significance\r\nThough he struggled to become successful, Peale painted the Patriæ Pater, one such masterpiece marking success during his 50-year career. A rectangle supporting an oval wreath surrounds the eye-catching image of George Washington. The most successful painting of Peale's career, it further inspired John Marshall to have his portrait done by Peale in the same fashion. The painting was criticized for the lack of authenticity, as it was not completed until after Washington's death (1799). Nonetheless, Peale received commendations for his portrait by many noted politicians such as Washington’s nephew, Judge Bushrod Washington, who was an associate U.S. Supreme Court Justice, and Marshall.[8].\r\n\r\n \r\nRembrandt Peale, Rubens Peale with a Geranium, 1801In 1801, Rembrandt painted a portrait of his brother Rubens, youngest of the 6 Peale children, who always had an admiration for gardening and tending to natural life. Inspired by his brother’s gardening appreciation, Rembrandt seated his younger brother next to a geranium. Viewers must understand the story behind this particular painting, as it carries more than the artist’s admiration for a sibling’s love of nature. The painting was the initial inspiration of the Dutch 17th century artist, David Teniers the Younger, who had painted the 5 senses series, all oil on copper. His painting, \"Smell\" is quite similar to Rembrandt Peale’s work of art, which depicts a man looking over at another individual admiring a flower pot. Rembrandt's piece captures the essence of a young gardener\/artist’s peace of mind, gracefully looking out, a posture of wonder and calmness.[9]\r\n\r\n \r\nRembrandt Peale, The Roman Daughter, 1811A particular piece based on the neoclassical genre, “The Roman Daughter” deserves critical acclaim for Peale’s efforts to re-establish classical paintings in the early 19th century. The township of Philadelphia could not accept the neoclassical painting, as it demonstrated too “sensational” of a painting.[10] They did not understand, however, that Peale was trying his endeavors to bring forth a new genre of style for the township and “improving the state of fine arts in America” in the 19th century.[11] “The Roman Daughter” depicts a young girl shielding her father, a prisoner in chains. This piece demonstrates compassion and graceful defense, like Roman murals such as those by Italian painted and sculptor, Michelangelo Buonarrotti, who painted the world-renowned Sistine Chapel. His copy of Corraggio's Angel, and Court of Death revealed the same artistic style.[12]\r\n\r\n\r\n[edit] A portrait identified\r\nPeale had painted over 600 identified paintings, but one painting persisted as unnamed for many years. The comedian never identified himself as the person in the picture, but had an acquaintance with the British painter, George Clint, who claimed the picture as his own until the National Portrait Gallery of London examined it in 1914. Clint had a style quite similar to Peale, and a vendor of the National Portrait Gallery of London, Charles Huggins, confirmed it was Clint’s artwork. Later on, the gallery further examined the history behind the painting. Mathews had arrived in New York in 1822, and left shortly after Peale had welcomed the English comedian for portrait painting.[13]\r\n\r\n\r\n[edit] Legacy\r\nRecognized by American presidents George Washington and Thomas Jefferson[14], Chief Justice John Marshall[15], and John C. Calhoun, Rembrandt Peale was one of the most prolific political painters of his era, having completed over 600 paintings. He died June 12, 1860 in Philadelphia, but his paintings live on through family collections and nationwide exhibitions displaying his famous works. Like his father, Charles Willson Peale, Rembrandt Peale was known as one of the most distinguished painters to live through debts and successes.\r\n\r\n\r\n[edit] Exhibitions\r\n \r\nMary Denison, Later Mrs. Alexander C.

"Biography":"James Peale (1749 – May 24, 1831) was an American painter, best known for his miniature and still life paintings, and a younger brother of noted painter Charles Willson Peale.\r\n\r\nPeale was born in Chestertown, Maryland, the second child, after Charles, of Charles Peale (1709–1750) and Margaret Triggs (1709–1791). His father died when he was an infant, and the family moved to Annapolis. In 1762 he began to serve apprenticeships there, first in a saddlery and later in a cabinetmaking shop. After his brother Charles returned from London in 1769, where he had studied with Benjamin West, Peale served as his assistant and learned how to paint.\r\n\r\nPeale worked in his brother's studio until January 14, 1776, when he accepted a commission in the Continental Army as an ensign in William Smallwood's regiment. Within three months he was promoted to captain, and during the next three years fought in the battles of Long Island, White Plains, Trenton, Brandywine, Germantown, Princeton, and Monmouth. He resigned his army commission in 1779, and moved to Philadelphia to live with his brother. In 1782 he married, after which he established his own household and artistic career. (One notable later collaboration, however, was in 1788 to make floats for Philadelphia's Federal Procession in honor of the newly drafted United States Constitution.)\r\n\r\nAt the outset of his career Peale painted portraits and still-life, and by the mid-1780s had established his reputation. At about this time, however, Charles turned over his own miniature portrait practice to him, and throughout the 1790s and early 1800s Peale devoted himself to miniature painting. Much of this work was watercolor on ivory. In 1795 Peale exhibited a still life of fruit along with nine miniatures and his family portrait at the Columbianum, a short-lived art academy in Philadelphia. Around 1810, as Peale's eyesight began to weaken, he gave up painting miniatures to turn to large portraits and still-life subjects that were greatly admired and widely exhibited in Philadelphia, Boston, and Baltimore.\r\n\r\nThe total number of Peale's landscape paintings remains unknown, but he executed more than 200 watercolor miniatures on ivory, perhaps 100 still-life paintings, fewer than 70 oil portraits, and at least 8 history paintings.\r\n\r\nPeale died in Philadelphia on May 24, 1831. Three of his six children became accomplished painters: Anna Claypoole Peale (1798–1871), a miniaturist and still-life painter; Margaretta Angelica Peale (1795–1882), painter of trompe l’oeil subjects and tabletop fruit; and Sarah Miriam Peale (1800–1885), a portraitist and still-life painter\r\n",

"Biography":"Everett Raymond Kinstler is a native New Yorker who began his career at age 16, drawing comic books and hundreds of book and magazine illustrations, as well as covers for paper back books. As one of the \"golden age\" era of comic book artists, his illustrations for magazines, including The Shadow and Doc Savage, have influenced the pop art school. \r\nHe studied at the Art Students League, where he later taught from 1969 to 1974. Kinstler ultimately made the transition to portraitist, and soon established himself as one of the nation's foremost portrait painters. For over four decades, Kinstler also has devoted time to painting landscapes and watercolors.\r\n\r\nAmong Kinstler's more than 1200 portraits are such well-known personalities as Tony Bennett, Carol Burnett, James Cagney, Betty Ford, Gene Hackman, Katharine Hepburn, Lady Bird Johnson, Paul Newman, Peter O'Toole, Gregory Peck, and John Wayne. Others include authors Arthur Miller, Ayn Rand, Tennessee Williams, and Tom Wolfe; Supreme Court Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Harry Blackmun; business and government leaders such as John D. Rockefeller lll, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, 6 U.S. Governors, four US Secretaries of State, and the presidents of universities and colleges including Brown, Harvard, Oklahoma, Princeton, Smith, Wellesley, Williams, and Yale.\r\n\r\nKinstler has painted more than 50 cabinet officers, more than any artist in the country's history. Six Presidents--Richard Nixon, Gerald R. Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton have posed for him. His portraits of Ford and Reagan are the official White House portraits.\r\n\r\nHe was awarded honorary doctorates by Rollins College in 1983 and the Lyme Academy College of Art in 2002. The National Portrait Gallery, Washington, D.C., has acquired 75 of his original works for its permanent collection. He is also represented in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Butler Institute of American Art, Brooklyn Museum, etc.\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/www.everettraymondkinstler.com\/pages\/about_erk_biography.html\r\n",

"Biography":"Charles Robert Knight (October 21, 1874 in Brooklyn – April 15, 1953 in Manhattan) was an American artist best known for his influential paintings of dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals. His works have been reproduced in many books and are currently on display at several major museums in the United States.\r\n\r\nAs a child, Knight was deeply interested in nature and animals, and spent many hours copying the illustrations from his father’s natural history books. Though legally blind because of astigmatism and a subsequent injury to his right eye, Knight pursued his artistic talents with the help of specially-designed glasses, and at the age of twelve, he enrolled at the Metropolitan Art School to become a commercial artist. In 1890, he was hired by a church-decorating firm to design stained-glass windows, and after two years with them, became a freelance illustrator for books and magazines, specializing in nature scenes.\r\n\r\nIn his free time, Knight visited the American Museum of Natural History, attracting the attention of Dr. Jacob Wortman, who asked Knight to paint a restoration of a prehistoric pig whose fossilized bones were on display. Though many artists at the time were reluctant to make such restorations, given the amount of guesswork involved, Knight applied his knowledge of modern pig anatomy to make the painting as realistic as possible, and used his imagination to fill in any gaps. Wortman was thrilled with the final result, and the museum soon commissioned Knight to produce an entire series of watercolors to grace their fossil halls. These paintings were hugely popular among visitors, and Knight continued to work with the museum well until the 1930s, painting what would become some of the world’s most celebrated images of dinosaurs, prehistoric mammals, and prehistoric humans.\r\n \r\nLeaping Laelaps by Charles R. Knight, 1897One of Knight's best-known pieces for the American Museum of Natural History is 1897’s Leaping Laelaps, which was one of the few pre-1960s images to present dinosaurs as active, fast-moving creatures (thus anticipating the theories of modern paleontologists like Robert Bakker). Other familiar American Museum paintings include Knight’s portrayals of Agathaumas, Allosaurus, Brontosaurus, Smilodon, and the Woolly Mammoth. All of these have been reproduced in numerous places and have inspired many imitations.\r\n\r\nSoon, natural history museums throughout the country began requesting Knight paintings for their own fossil exhibits. In 1925, for example, Knight produced an elaborate mural for the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County which portrayed some of the birds and mammals whose remains had been found in the nearby La Brea Tar Pits. The following year, Knight began a 28-mural series for Chicago’s Field Museum of Natural History, a project which chronicled the history of life on earth and took four years to complete. At the Field Museum, he produced one of his best-known pieces, a mural featuring Tyrannosaurus and Triceratops. This confrontation scene between a predator and its prey would inspire a huge number of imitations, establishing the two dinosaurs as “mortal enemies” in the popular consciousness. The Field Museum’s Alexander Sherman says, “It is so well-loved that it has become the standard encounter for portraying the age of dinosaurs”.\r\n\r\n \r\nTrachodon (Anatotitan) from 1905Knight’s work also found its way to the Carnegie Museums in Pittsburgh the Smithsonian Institution, and Yale's Peabody Museum of Natural History, among others. Several zoos, such as the Bronx Zoo, the Lincoln Park Zoo, and the Brookfield Zoo, also approached Knight to paint murals of their living animals, and Knight enthusiastically complied. Knight was actually the only person in America allowed to paint Su Lin, a giant panda that lived at Brookfield Zoo during the 1930s.\r\n\r\nWhile making murals for museums and zoos, Knight continued illustrating books and magazines, and became a frequent contributor to National Geographic. He also wrote and illustrated several books of his own, such as Before the Dawn of History (Knight, 1935), Life Through the Ages (1946), Animal Drawing: Anatomy and Action for Artists (1947), and Prehistoric Man: The Great Adventure (1949). Additionally, Knight became a popular lecturer, describing prehistoric life to audiences across the country.\r\n\r\nEventually, Knight began to retire from the public sphere to spend more time with his grandchildren, who shared his passion for animals and prehistoric life. In 1951, he painted his last work, a mural for the Everhart Museum in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Two years later, he died peacefully in Manhattan.\r\n\r\nBrontosaurus by Charles R. Knight, 1902Examples of Knight's work frequently appeared in dinosaur books published in the US during the first half of the twentieth century.[3] Many works released since then also include examples of Knight’s paintings; for example, Stephen Jay Gould used one of Knight’s paintings for the cover of his 1991 book Bully for Brontosaurus and another in his 1996 book Dinosaur in a Haystack. Though many other paleoartists have succeeded Knight (most notably Zdenek Burian) Knight’s paintings still remain very popular among paleontology enthusiasts. A commemorative edition of Knight’s 1946 book Life Through the Ages [ISBN 0-253-33928-6] was recently published by Indiana University Press, and a 2007 calendar [ISBN 0-7649-3622-0] of Knight’s paintings is also currently available. Additionally, fantasy artist William Stout has been compiling a series of Charles Knight Sketchbooks, which contain many rare and previously unpublished drawings and studies by Knight.\r\n\r\nKnight's restoration of Agathaumas from 1897, which was later used as basis for a model Agathaumas used in the 1925 film The Lost World. 1922 New Year's Card by Charles R. KnightBecause Knight worked in an era when new and often fragmentary fossils were coming out of the American west in quantity, not all of his creations were based on solid evidence; dinosaurs such as his improbably-adorned Agathaumas (1897: left) for example, were somewhat speculative. His depictions of better-known ceratopsians as solitary animals inhabiting lush grassy landscapes were largely imaginative (the grasslands that feature in many of his paintings didn't appear until the Cenozoic and ceratopsians are known to have been gregarious animals). Although Knight sometimes made musculoskeletal studies of living animals, he did not do so for his dinosaur restorations, and he restored many dinosaurs with typical reptilian-like limbs and narrow hips (Paul, 1996). In the 1920s, studies by the celebrated palaeontologists Alfred Romer and Gerhard Heilmann (Heilmann, 1926) had confirmed that dinosaurs had broad avian-like hips rather than those of a typical reptile. Knight often restored extinct mammals, birds and marine reptiles in very dynamic action poses, but his depictions of large dinosaurs as ponderous swamp-dwellers destined for extinction reflected more traditional concepts (Paul, 1996). In his catalogue to Life through the Ages (1946), he reiterated views that he had written earlier (Knight, 1935), describing the great beasts as \"slow-moving dunces\" that were \"unadaptable and unprogressive\" while conceding that small dinosaurs had been more active.\r\n\r\nThe late Stephen Jay Gould was one of Knight’s most well-known fans, notably refusing to refer to Brontosaurus as “Apatosaurus” because Knight had always referred to the creature with the former name [2]. Gould writes in his 1989 book Wonderful Life, “Not since the Lord himself showed his stuff to Ezekiel in the valley of dry bones had anyone shown such grace and skill in the reconstruction of animals from disarticulated skeletons. Charles R. Knight, the most celebrated of artists in the reanimation of fossils, painted all the canonical figures of dinosaurs that fire our fear and imagination to this day” [5]. Other admirers have included special effects artist Ray Harryhausen, who writes in his autobiography An Animated Life, “Long before Obie (Willis O'Brien), myself, and Steven Spielberg, he put flesh on creatures that no human had ever seen. […] At the L.A. County Museum I vividly remember a beautiful Knight mural on one of the walls depicting the way the tar pits would have looked in ancient times. This, plus a picture book about Knight’s work my mother gave me, were my first encounters with a man who was to prove an enormous help when the time came for me to make three-dimensional models of these extinct beings”.\r\n\r\nAn homage to the painter was also made in the IMAX feature film, T-Rex: Back to the Cretaceous, in which he was portrayed by actor Tuck Milligan.\r\nWikipedia",

He seems to have been active as an artist until about 1837. Lawrence exhibited at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia, through 1832, showing views of Bordentown for a few years and, after 1815, almost exclusively portraits. An exception to this was his copy of Jacques-Louis David's Napoleon Crossing the Alps, which was shown regularly there from 1831 to 1870. From 1840 to 1842, Charles B. Lawrence worked as a clerk for the \"Bank of Penn. Township,\" and from 1844 to 1856, he was listed in as a plumber in Philadelphia. Virtually nothing is known of him after this date, and it is believed that he died about 1864. He is not listed in the 1870 United States Census.\r\nhttp:\/\/www.cavaliergalleries.com\/artist_bio.php?artist_id=848\r\n",

"Biography":"\r\nMERRITT, Anna Lea, artist, born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 13 September, 1844. Her maiden name was Anna Massey Lea. She was twenty-one years of age before she turned her attention to painting, and subsequently studied under Professor Heinrich Hoffmann, of Dresden, and Henry Merritt, of London, whom she married in April, 1877. In 1871 she went to London to reside, and the same year exhibited \"A Scene on the Grand Canal, Venice,\" and \" Portrait of a Young Lady.\" Of her pictures since exhibited, \"Eve Overcome by Remorse\" has attracted the most attention. She was represented at the Philadelphia centennial exhibition, and received a diploma and medal. After the death of her husband, Henry Merritt, an artist and author, she published a memorial of him entitled \"Henry Merritt's Art Criticism and Romance, with Recollections and Twenty-three Etchings\" (London, 1879). To supply a portrait of her husband she studied the art of etching, which led to her adopting it as a profession. She has also etched \" Two Portraits of Mary Wolstonecraft,\" \"View on the Thames,\" \"Portrait of Sir Gilbert Scott,\" and \"Ellen Terry as Ophelia.\" She has exhibited at the London academy \"The Pied Piper of Hamelin\" (1872) ; \" St. Cecilia\" and \"A Bacchante \" (1875); \"A Girl with Doves \" (1876); \"Camilla\" (1883) ; and various portraits. At present she resides in London, but frequently visits New York city and Philadelphia, where she has painted a number of portraits. She is a relative of Henry C. Lea (q. v.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEdited Appletons Encyclopedia, Copyright © 2001 VirtualologyTM",

"Biography":"Frederick William MacMonnies, the son of a Scottish emigrant, was born in Brooklyn in 1863.(1)  As a young boy, he modeled small figures and animals in white wax.  Later, while barely in his teens, he took an ice pick for a chisel and carved an image of his pet frog from stone.(2)  Even though his parents recognized his precocious artistic gift, they did not have the financial resources to send him to art school.  As a result, he went to work in a jewelry shop.  \r\n\r\nWhen MacMonnies was 18, he began working at odd jobs in the New York studio of the famous sculptor, Auguste Saint-Gaudens.  After a chance opportunity to make a couple of his own sculptures, Saint-Gaudens became aware of MacMonnies’ innate artistic ability and promoted him to the rank of assistant.  In the evenings, he supplemented these studio lessons with art studies at the National Academy of Design and the Art Students League.  In 1884 he left to further his studies in Paris, where he entered Jean Alexandre Falquière’s sculpture class at the École des Beaux-Arts.  MacMonnies won the highest prize available to a foreigner at the school for two successive years - the Prix d’Atelier, which was second only to the Prix de Rome.  \r\n\r\nAt the Salon of 1889, MacMonnies achieved significant praise for his Diana, the original plaster version, which was awarded an honorable mention.  Following the success of the Salon and Diana, his fame increased and he received many commissions on both sides of the Atlantic. With this sudden fame also came criticism, especially with MacMonnies' 1893 statue of Bacchante, which eventually ended up in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.(3)  He was identified with our country’s elite group of sculptors who created public statues during the American Renaissance, known as the Gilded Age, which occurred from the mid-1870s to the early 1900s. During this 30-year period, sculptors, architects and painters sought to create art that would refine the public’s artistic taste, by looking for inspiration from ancient Greek, Roman and Italian Renaissance art.  They revised mythological subjects and heroic allegories.  Sculpture during this period was buoyant, decorative and often highly expressive.  MacMonnies’ Barge of State for the Chicago World Fair (1892-93) was all of this and more.  This piece measured sixty feet long and contained thirty-eight figures.(4)\r\nIn 1896, MacMonnies received the Order of the Chevalier of the Legion of Honor from the French government.  By 1905, he had opened a studio\/school in Giverny, France and married Mary Louise Fairchild of St. Louis.  However, the First World War had caused major disruptions to the economy and life in Europe, and in 1915, MacMonnies returned to America where he remained for the rest of his life. \r\n\r\nMacMonnies died from pneumonia in 1937.  A victim of changing aesthetic tastes in postwar America, he never strayed from his Beaux-Art approach to sculpture, even though this style had been replaced largely by modern trends in the twentieth century well before his death. \r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/www.askart.com\/AskART\/artists\/biography.aspx?artist=23774 3\/6\/09",

His images are classical and formal in appearance, his favorites subjects being male nudes, flowers, and still lifes. His homoerotic images became the subject of a much publicized obscenity charge in 1990 involving the Cincinnati Art Museum. Mapplethorpe also did a series of self-portraits toward the end of his life, documenting his deteriorating health from AIDS (ULAN).",

"Biography":"Elisabeth Gordon Chandler was born in St. Louis, Missouri, initially trained as a harpist, and was performing professionally by the age of eighteen. However, as a young woman she decided to pursue a career in the visual arts, and in New York City studied sculpture with Edmondo Quattocchi, and anatomy with Robert Beverly Hale at the Art Students League of New York.\r\n\r\nChandler received a number of honors; her first award came in 1945, when her bronze figure Victory won first prize in the Brooklyn War Memorial competition. Subsequently she garnered awards from the National Academy of Design and the National Sculpture Society, and was the recipient of the Governor's Art Award, State of Connecticut, and an Honorary Doctorate from St. Joseph's College, West Hartford, Connecticut. Her sculpture has been housed in St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City, the British Museum in London, Columbia University School of Law, and Princeton University. Chandler excelled especially in portraiture, and produced busts which were definitive images of such notables as Nobelist Dr. Albert Michelson, United States Secretary of Defense James Forrestal, Supreme Court Chief Justices John Jay, Charles Evans Hughes and Harlan Fiske Stone, actor Charles Coburn, artists James Montgomery Flagg and Alphaeus Philemon Cole, and Adlai Stevenson.\r\n\r\nIn 1962 Chandler moved from New York City to Old Lyme, Connecticut. In 1976 she founded the Lyme Academy of Fine Arts (now the Lyme Academy College of Fine Arts) in order to provide students with an education in traditional, representational art. In addition to being the school's founder, she served as a professor of sculpture and trustee of the college until her death.\r\n\r\nChandler was twice married and widowed, first to Robert Kirkland Chandler, and later to fellow sculptor Laci de Gerenday. Professionally she took the name of her first husband, but socially she was known as Elisabeth de Gerenday. (Wikipedia 2\/09)\r\n\r\n",

After a figurative period, in the manner of Mexican mural artists, Guston became involved in the development of American Abstract Expressionism. In 1968 he made a radical return to figuration, waiting until 1970 to reveal this work publicly. These new cartoon-like works were not well-received when first shown, but have become highly regarded over time. (ULAN)",

"Biography":"Dimitri Hadzi, an internationally known sculptor whose most famous work is at once mythic and modernist, died on April 16 in Boston. He was 85 and lived in Cambridge, Mass.\r\n\r\nAt his death, Mr. Hadzi was emeritus professor of visual and environmental studies at Harvard, where he had taught sculpture and printmaking for many years. Mr. Hadzi was known in particular for his semi-abstract sculptures in bronze and stone. Many have titles like \"Pillars of Hercules\" and \"Apollonian Libation\" that hark back to classical antiquity.\r\n\r\nHis work, tall and imposing, gives hints of figuration, incorporating long, columnar forms that can suggest the limbs of people or animals. It was praised by critics for its impeccable craftsmanship, energy and carefully calibrated interplay of solid form with open space.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing a 1961 exhibition of Mr. Hadzi's work in The New York Times, Brian O'Doherty called him \"a major talent,\" adding, \"He is a very thoughtful sculptor, and his work displaces space with the authority and logic of great conviction.\"\r\n\r\nIn New York, one of Mr. Hadzi's most visible public sculptures, \"K. 458 The Hunt,\" is on display in the lobby of Avery Fisher Hall at Lincoln Center. Made of black-coated bronze, it stands more than 10 feet high on three sinuous limbs. Its title refers to Mozart's String Quartet in B flat, K. 458.\r\n\r\nHis many other commissions include \"Omphalos,\" in Harvard Square; \"Thermopylae,\" at the John F. Kennedy Federal Building in Boston; and a pair of sculptured bronze doors for St. Paul's Within the Walls Episcopal Church in Rome.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, Mr. Hadzi turned to making smaller sculptures of wood-fired stoneware, which nevertheless managed to convey a sense of epic proportion on a more intimate scale.\r\n\r\nDimitri Hadzi was born in Greenwich Village on March 21, 1921, to parents who had emigrated from Greece. Raised in Brooklyn, he took classes at the Brooklyn Museum School of Art but went on to study chemistry at the Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute. \r\n\r\nIn World War II, Mr. Hadzi served with the Army Air Forces in the South Pacific. When the war was over, he resolved to become an artist after all and enrolled at Cooper Union.\r\n\r\nAfter graduating with honors in 1950, Mr. Hadzi accepted a Fulbright Fellowship to study in Greece, and for many years afterward he lived in Rome. He returned to the United States in the mid-1970's.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Hadzi, who represented the United States in the Venice Biennales of 1956, 1958 and 1962, was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the National Academy of Design. He was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1978.\r\n\r\nHis work is in the collections of many major museums, among them the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum, the Guggenheim Museum, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.\r\n\r\nNYTimes Obituary",

"Biography":"Inge Ruth Hardison is the creator of the series of sculpted portraits entitled, \"Negro Giants In History\". She started this series in 1963 with an 8\" bust of Harriet Tubman. Through the years other portraits followed: Paul Robeson, Frederick Douglass, Dr. W.E.B. Dubois, Dr. Mary McLeod Bethune, Dr. Washington Carver, Sojourner Truth and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.. \r\n\r\nThe essence of their character as well as their likeness are aptly depicted in Ms. Hardison's sculptured presentation. Her desire in their creation was to put this legacy of art into the hands of many. She feels that there has always been a need for heroes, but especially in today's world. She has even extended the art form to include a Sojourner Truth pin, a wearable work of art and prized jewelry.\r\n\r\nInge Hardison has also been commissioned to do various works, including the Ingenious Americans series: portraits of African American doctors, scientists, and inventors. In Harlem her 35-inch bronze head of Jackie Robinson is installed in the play center after him. The \"New Generation\" bronze mural of 18 boys and girls on the outside of Intermediate School #74 in the Bronx is also to her credit. \r\n\r\n  A 21-inch bronze head of Frederick Douglass as a youth was commissioned by the Black Princeton Alumni and unveiled in 1983 in the Firestone Library of Princeton University. In 1998, Ms. Hardison completed a commission of a monumental bronze figure entitled \"Jubilee\" for the Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn, NY.\r\n\r\n  Inge Hardison is included in \"Call Them Heroes\", a social studies textbook, published by the Board of Edication of NY.; \"Handstands\", a social studies textbook published by Allyn & Bacon, Boston, Mass.; \"One Hundred Successful Blacks\", Book 2, Ebony Success Library; \"Who's Who Among Black Americans\"; and \"Who's Who in America\".\r\n\r\n  Hardison's 24-inchhigh portrait of Sojourner Truth was presented to Nelson Mandela by NY Governor Cuomo in 1990. The sculptures Dr. Mary Mcleod Bethune and W.E.B. Dubois were used in a presentation to DC Mayor, Sharon Pratt Dixon, the entire Congressional Black Caucus and to Chief Bashorun M.K.O. Abiola of Nigeria in 1991. The 2-foot standing Sojourner Truth was used in a presentation in 1995 to the Sewell-Belmont House Museum and Portrait Gallery in Washington, DC.\r\n\r\n  In February 2004, Inge Hardison was one of the \"Harlem is...\" Honorees recognized for their significant influence on the arts in Harlem. She acknowledges that Harlem has been a very important experience in her life.\r\n\r\n  Tony Brown, in his syndicated column of August 1987 wrote: \"...This woman's life has been dedicated to preserving our legacy. She will keep the eternal flame of our struggle alive in her genius.\"\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n  \r\n",

"Biography":"After studying abroad in the late 1850s, William Stanley Haseltine returned to the United States to concentrate his efforts on painting the beauty of the American landscape. Traveling to the coast of Rhode Island and the North Shore of Massachusetts, Haseltine executed a series of vivid landscapes that celebrate the bold rock formations of those particular locales.  \r\n\r\nMarc Simpson writes, \"Haseltine's record of exhibited American scenes reveals a sensibility akin to that of the poet and essayist Henry David Thoreau, who wrote, 'My years are like a stroll upon the beach\/As near the ocean's edge as I can go.” From Maine's Mount Desert Island south approximately three hundred miles to Rhode Island's Point Judith, Haseltine, too, repeatedly traveled as near the ocean's edge as he could go, recording the wonders of the shore in crisply detailed drawings and careful oil studies. These, and the paintings derived from them, are among the artist's most original and memorable works.\r\n\r\nHaseltine's American coastal views are the works of an accomplished and well educated artist just setting out on his career. His depictions of specific rock formations and particular light conditions frequently prompted enthusiastic recognition of a favored spot by critics and, presumably, patrons. Further, his contemporaries were able to find some of the most important movements of the age reflected in these works. The belief that art's purpose was best expressed through the accurate depiction of nature and the recognition of geology as a science with the authority to rival scriptural accounts of the early creation. Both recognizability and the resonance of his art grew from Haseltine's choice of elemental subjects observed closely and recreated faithfully. In his best American paintings—pared down visions of rock, sea, and sky—the land formations speak with geological truthfulness, the waves break convincingly, and a palpable atmosphere suffuses the whole.\" (Expressions of Place: The Art of William Stanley Haseltine, San Francisco, California, 1992, P. 15).\r\n\r\nHaseltine received positive critical response for works of the coastal rocks, and the artist came to be something of a fixture at Nahant. Marc Simpson writes, \"The art press reported on Haseltine's stay at Nahant, aptly mentioning both art and society as occupations: 'Haseltine divides his time between fashion and the sea at Nahant.' The same periodical, Watson's, praised the results of his summer's works when he had returned to the studio later in the fall,  'Haseltine, who passed the summer months at Nahant, has brought back many admirable studies of the scenery of that neighborhood... it is within three years that Mr. Haseltine has come into notice as a painter of coast scenes, and so marked has been his success, that his prominence and superiority in the portrayal of the rocky shores of Nahant and Narragansett are by all fully acknowledged.\"' (Expressions of Place: The Art of William Stanley Haseltine, p. 23)\r\n\r\n \r\n  \r\n",

Graduating from the Institute, he furthered his study at the Royal Academy in Munich, with the American expatriate artist, Carl von Marr, and then in Paris, at the Académie Julian with Jean Paul Laurens; at the Académie Colarossi with Richard E. Miller. Haupt was back in Baltimore in 1915, and by 1918 was teaching drawing at the Maryland Institute through 1925. By 1930 he was living on Gramercy Park, New York, a member of the National Arts Club there where he exhibited frequently, and where he enjoyed a one-artist show in 1972. Though Haupt painted figure works and garden scenes, he turned increasingly to the lucrative field of formal portraiture, where his work can be found in the Supreme Court and the Sons of the American Revolution in Washington, D. C.; the Chamber of Commerce, New York; Yale University; and Randolph-Macon Woman's College in Lynchburg, Virginia. \r\n\r\n",

"Biography":"Henry Hering was an American sculptor who was born New York City on February 15, 1874 and died there on January 17, 1949.\r\n\r\nHe was a student of Augustus Saint-Gaudens at Cooper Union and of Philip Martiny at the Art Students League. He then went to Paris where he studied at the École des Beaux-Arts.\r\n\r\nFollowing his return from Paris Hering worked as an assistant to Augustus Saint-Gaudens until Saint-Gaudens' death in 1907. In 1910 Hering married another long time Saint-Gaudens' assistant, Elsie Ward, who gave up her independent career as a sculptor, to serve as her husband's assistant.\r\n\r\nHenry Haring is well known for his work as an architectural sculptor. Although a few of his later works are Art Deco in style, notably the Severance Hall decorations and the Lorain-Carnegie Bridge, most of his work consists of allegorical figures in the Beaux-Arts tradition. His reputation as a sculptor decreased as International Modernism dispensed with architectural, figurative and allegorical work. As with many other such artists Hering's oeuvre is now being reexamined in a more positive light.\r\n\r\nThe National Sculpture Society gives out the Henry Hering Award every year for noteworthy collaboration between sculptor and architect.\r\n \r\nWikipedia 2009\r\n\r\n",

In 1735, Hesselius returned to Philadelphia where he would live the remainder of his life.\r\n\r\nHesselius also worked as an organ builder, having built an organ for the Moravian Church in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania in 1746. \r\n\r\n",

"Biography":"Lewis W. Hines is widely recognized as the outstanding exponent of social documentary photography in America. He began taking photographs in 1904, and soon realized that the camera was in important instrument for teaching, as well as recording social conditions in America's inner city. He taught at a photographic club in 1905 and was later joined by Paul Strand. He worked for the National Child Labor Committee from 1906 to 1917, photographing children working in coalmines and factories. He traveled extensively throughout the United States documenting the social conditions of children and giving lectures on behalf of the National Child Labor Committee. He joined the Red Cross in 1918, which sent him to France. Upon his return to New York in 1919, he changed his straightforward objective style to a more interpretive approach, advertising his work as \"Lewis Wickes Hine, Interpretive Photography.\" In 1930, Hine was given the task of photographing the construction of the Empire State Building. His images of workers on scaffolds high above the city streets are among his most famous (ULAN).",

"Biography":"Hopper was one of the premier Realist painters of the 1930s and 1940s. In 1900, Hopper studied portrait and still-life painting with William Merritt Chase, but he preferred to take classes with Kenneth Hayes Miller and Robert Henri. In 1906, Hopper worked as a part-time illustrator, but by autumn of that year he went to Paris to study the work of European artists. His painting from this period and soon after reflects the influence of \"plein air\" painting and Impressionism. Hopper continued to work as an illustrator, garnering more critical and commercial success with it than painting, although he loathed this work. By 1925, Hopper began to develop his signature, where the focus is on only one or two solitary figures often consumed by vast outdoors spaces or cramped city streets. His landscapes also evoke a similar haunting loneliness. One of Hopper's most well known works is a poignant portrayal of urban alienation, \"The Night Hawks\" (1942). With the emergence of Abstract Expressionism in the 1940s, Hopper's work was seen as illustrative and obsolete. Pop Art and Photorealism resurrected his reputation. American artist (ULAN).",

"Biography":"Portraitist Ernest Ipsen was born near Boston to Danish parents. His father, Ludvig S. Ipsen, was an architect with a genius for design, and his mother was a well-known musician with a beautiful voice. The families of both were closely connected with the Danish court, and young Ernest was sent to the Royal Academy in Copenhagen after his preliminary training in Boston. There, he speedily won a prize for his figure works, and a scholarship in life painting. Upon his return to America, Ipsen opened a studio in Boston. In 1908, he married Edith Boyden Crocker. His distinguished portrait of his wife was one of his early paintings to be shown at the Academy. A versatile artist, he loved textures and surfaces. Ipsen was an enthusiastic sailor and liked to paint marinescapes and landscapes. He earned numerous prizes with his pictures, which were bought by many museums. Ipsen painted a remarkable number of official portraits, and examples are in almost every great institution in America. The late Maurice Francis Egan, hangs in the royal palace in Denmark. A portrait of Edwin Howland Blashfield, once found in the National Academy of Design, was displayed in the Centenary exhibition. A portrait of Thomas W. Slocum hangs in the Harvard Club of New York City; John Bates Clarke, in Columbia University; Dr. Henry Van Dyke in the Princeton Club, New York; and George A. Plimpton, Lenor F. Loree, Elihu Root, are other official portraits. Private portraits by Ipsen include Miss Anna Leach; Mrs. William Sloane, art patron of Norfolk; Justice Parker and Mrs. Parker, Arthur Scribner, John Lane, W. Rutherford Mead, and J. J. Haverty, who did much for art in Atlanta. The artists personal charm and his sympathetic understanding is reflected in the portraits of his sitters, whom he seems to have found in happy moments.

"Biography":"Irving and Casson was a Boston, Massachusetts, firm of interior designers and furniture makers, founded in 1875.  Its specialty was interior woodwork and mantels, but it also made furniture, primarily in the styles of the 17th and 18th centuries.  In 1914 or 1916, the firm merged with A.H. Davenport, a furniture company also located in Boston (both had factories in East Cambridge).  After the merger, the company executed a number of commissions for Gothic Revival churches, including the chapels at Duke University and the University of Pittsburgh.  The company’s last major design commission was for the interiors for the United Nations buildings in New York City, executed in the 1950s.  Irving and Casson-A.H. Davenport went out of business in 1974.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n",

He lived at first in Philadelphia, afterwards establishing himself in New York City, where he enjoyed great popularity, though his conviviality and eccentric mode of life affected his work. He visited Baltimore, Charleston, and New Orleans, entertaining much and painting portraits of prominent people, particularly in New Orleans, where General Andrew Jackson was one of his sitters. He had for assistants at different times both Thomas Sully and Henry Inman. He affected singularity in dress and manners, and his mots were the talk of the day. But his work deteriorated, and he died in great poverty in New York City. Examples of his painting are in the collections of the New York Historical Society and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\r\n(Wikipedia 1\/15\/09)\r\n\r\n",

In 1910­1911 he studied at the prestigious Art Students League in New York, where he took portrait and still life painting with William Merritt Chase and figure drawing with George Bridgman.\r\n\r\nAfter a short interlude in Alabama, he settled in Manhattan.  He taught at the Art Students League, first in 1919, and then from 1949 until 1973. His mainstay was portraiture, and his sitters included John D. Rockefeller, Samuel Kress, Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia, and Governor Thomas Kilby of Alabama.  His philosophy was simple:  \"I never start a portrait with a preconceived idea about the sitter. I feel so much may be revealed in a face. A banker: why a banker may have the quality of a poet.\"\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/www.tfaoi.com\/aa\/3aa\/3aa296.htm\r\n\r\n",
